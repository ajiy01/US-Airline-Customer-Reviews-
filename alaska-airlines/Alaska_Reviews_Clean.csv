"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a bad experience on my return trip from Ft Lauderdale to Portland. The weather at FLL was rainy, but not terrible. Planes were departing and arriving. After pulling back from the gate we sat motionless for 15 minutes or so. The pilot came on to tell us we had a shortage of fuel, and this was due to the weather and it's impact to availability of fuel. We sat for another 30-45 minutes. During this time the pilot said due to the fuel shortage we would stop in Kansas City on our way to Seattle. After about an hour on the ground in FLL he came on again to apologize for the paperwork being very slow, some corrections that needed to be made to the new flight plans. The delays caused us to be 4 hours late in arriving in Seattle. Here's the problem with Alaska - 1. They lied to us. They don't prioritize honesty with their customers. The fuel shortage scenario he tried to explain was weak at best. It was raining = not enough fuel? Alaska sent me an email apologizing for the stop in KC, but said it was unavoidable due to stronger than expected headwinds. What really happened? Lot of us lost time and $ due to this. The official determination was wind, so no reimbursements for hotels or added costs to rebook. 2. they had a service failure followed by inability to make a service recovery. They were not prepared to handle the onslaught of people who needed help. A desk was there, we were not told where, we had to find it. 4 agents were there; they needed 10 to quickly deal with the problems. Seattle is their headquarters! They had 6 hours to prepare! I use this airline sparingly and will continue to do so. I have 1.8MM miles on Delta. I'm with them because they don't let stuff like this happen.

"Not Verified | Poor customer service and deceiving practices I recently had an extremely disappointing experience with Alaska Airlines' phone customer service. The representatives seemed uninterested in assisting, frequently hanging up the call or leaving me on indefinite hold. This neglect is unacceptable, particularly when travelers are seeking crucial information. Furthermore, there were misleading communications about flight delays. I was informed that my flight couldn't depart due to weather issues, yet there were no apparent weather problems. It's troubling to suspect that this may be a tactic to mask the mechanical issues with their older aircraft fleet. The apparent strategy of avoiding compensation by falsely attributing delays to weather is deceptive and unacceptable. Customers deserve honesty and transparency, especially when it concerns their travel plans. I strongly advise travelers to reconsider flying with Alaska Airlines. Their lack of responsible customer service and questionable operational practices warrant scrutiny. In summary, my experience with Alaska Airlines was deeply unsatisfactory, marked by poor communication and suspect practices.

"✅ Trip Verified |   The initial flight from Orlando was 1 hour and 40 minutes late. While I understand the crew has a specific amount of sleep assigned, that policy is not passed down to their patrons. I missed my connecting flight to Eugene Oregon because of the crew’s right to sleep, causing a 13 hour delay because there was not another flight until midnight. The parties that were to pick me up had to make the 2 hour drive from Seal Rock 2x that day. Returning, I arrived at the Eugene airport at 6:30 pm on 10/10/23 because My son and his wife had to work and could not provide transportation on 10/11/23 when my flight was scheduled. I tried to sleep but was told to move to the lobby. This caused me to go through TSA 2x. The automated announcement railed every few minutes incessantly about unattended baggage. The floor was cleaned for what felt like hours. No sleep may have been to be expected. My ticket listed Gate F, which does not exist. The telemonitor said Gate A4. Loading started at 12:59. I got concerned about 1:00 because I heard nothing. The flight was at Gate B1. I got there by 1:06 and was told that I had to reschedule. I arrived in Seattle at approximately 6, tired and unrested. I went to one of the restaurants for dinner. From 6:30-10:30 while waiting on the flight to Orlando, I ate and drank 4 glasses of wine. I still have gotten any sleep. My flight did not leave until 10:20 pm. I arrived, was allowed on, and sat down glad to have an opportunity to sleep. That would not happen. The FA said to come with her. I complied. The staff at the desk told me that I stumbled therefore I could not get on the plane. I hadn't been belligerent, aggressive, or bothered anyone. I argued with him for a moment. He had already called the police. I left the vicinity. The staff said my ticket would be refunded in 5-7 business days. I had only $130 and other tickets were running at min $400. I sat in the Seattle Airport all night because nothing was open and I did not know what to do. Staff saw me again Thurs. am, again with no sleep, and again called the cops on me, assumingly because he decided that I was not to be on the premises. I answered to the police that I had had a ticket, that I had a right to be there, and I would appreciate them not bothering me. I called Customer Service. No assistance. I went to the Alaskan CS Desk and spoke with Anthony. He was very helpful. Derrick, his Supervisor, very professional, said that he could not override the decision to allow me to fly with Alaska Airlines due to what that staff wrote in his report - I had harassed staff & become aggressive with the police, which is clearly not true if you review the camera footage I asked where I should stay and Derrick told me anywhere it did not interfere with their employment. Of which I agreed, stating that I had not done that previously. I told Derrick that he needed to tell his employee to stop calling the police on me. Due only to borrowing money from my 82 year old mother, I finally arrived at MCO airport at 10:30 am Fri am . I went to get my baggage CS They were locked.

"Not Verified |  The flight was fine. I choose Alaska because I find them reliable. My issue is regarding their lost and found. I left my phone onboard the plane. My fault I know. Maybe 20 - 30min after I leave the plane, I was in seat 9D so I was one of the first to offload. I immediately seek assistance. The baggage claim agent on 9/02, did a lot to try and help me. He tried calling the crew/gate agent or the cleaning service to see if they could look for my phone. We told me that everyone was gone because it was a late flight. Early in the morning is when the plane will be searched and cleaned for its next flight. I return on 9/03 to baggage claim to see if anything was turned in. These were of no help. They told me to file a claim (I did that the night before). They asked me to call the customer service number, I said with what phone? I stayed at the desk for 40 min on hold. Tried asking the baggage claim manager for assistance, she laughed and walked away. According to my find your phone, my phone was in Reno then California and now Mexico. I kept trying to have an agent contact the crew or gate agents so that my seat could be thoroughly checked. I was told there is no way to connect this people. Which I find strange. If the pilot's parents died, no one can contact them to give the news? I think not. Currently, I was told that my phone was not on the San Fran Return flight and may still be in Mexico. The issue is the lack of efficiency and protocol for lost items. If the plane was thoroughly checked on 9/02, my phone would be in Seattle (where I am). If it was thoroughly check in Reno or Bakersfield my phone would be closer to being returned to me. Now its in Mexico? I have asked multiple agents what happens when my phone is not returned? What is my compensation? No one has answered my questions. I am very confused and disappointed with this process. Its also very clear the planes are not cleaned or inspected between flights.

When i asked the flight attendant to pick the trash, he asked me if they’re mine and I said no, he said he’ll come later. He came later and asked me to give them to him, I asked for a tissue since i was not comfortable touching it, he said never mind, he’ll pick it up after take off. Checked my time, more than one and a half hour through flight, he came by to pick up drink cups, I asked him and he said since you don’t want to touch them (some one else’s trash), he will pick them after we landed (4:36 flight). I asked him to wait so i could find tissue from my bag, and that I do not wish to have smelly diaper during my entire flight in front of me, then he started laughing, and speaking very loud while turning his head around having eye contact with other passengers that: “Calm down, calm down, I’m just trying to be kind to you and help you out here”. In what planet asking a passenger who paid more than $1200 for her flight, to sit on seat with three trashes one being a dirty diaper, and asking her to keep them there during entire flight time is being kind to a person and helping that person.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I am writing this post to express my deep disappointment and frustration with the unprofessional treatment and poor customer service we experienced during a recent flight with Alaska Airlines. As loyal customers, my wife and I had planned a trip that was months in the making, with multiple reservations and arrangements in place. Our ordeal began when we approached the check-in counter and were informed that we were 10 minutes late. We politely sought assistance and an understanding of the situation from the front desk representative, but we were directed to speak to the Manager. However, instead of offering guidance or explaining the airline's policies, she displayed a complete lack of empathy and customer service skills. She was dismissive and outright rude, showing no willingness to help us despite the circumstances of our slight delay due to a long check-in line. We expected better treatment and a more supportive approach, especially from a manager. Her refusal to consider any alternative solutions and her insistence on offering only one inconvenient option left us feeling disrespected and devalued as customers. To our shock, the Manager canceled our entire trip without any valid reason or explanation, leaving us in tears and feeling completely helpless. Her action disrupted our meticulously planned vacation, including connected flights and multiple reservations, causing immense distress and frustration. During the entire interaction, we maintained our composure and never resorted to using inappropriate language, as the airline staff alleged. Instead, we were met with passive and dismissive responses from the supervisor when we sought her understanding and assistance in rectifying the situation. As loyal customers, we expected better treatment and support from Alaska Airlines when facing challenging situations.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked a round trip with this company for a family ER. First flight crew was great. Returning Flight I had an altercation with their senior flight attendant who had a disgusting behavior and escalated a situation that could've easily been handled by proper customer service and communication. I approached her and another flight attendant to use the restrooms when it was last call for restrooms use. I was coldly told by both to use the back restrooms where there was a huge line. I explained that I was in a hurry to use it since I've been holding my son who's been asleep the majority of the flight. She said someone was in there. I was aware and asked if I could use it afterwards, the flight attendant seated next to her said ""Yes"" then the senior flight attendant said to me: Maybe if you ask with less attitude you can go in there. Surprised by her response I tell her I did not give her attitude and that she did not need to speak that way and it is true because I did not yell or curse anyone out and even I supposedly gave you attitude, Aren't you trained to handle this in a proper way maybe by communicating with the customer? No, she stood up aggressively, got in my face and started telling me out loud in front of customers that she will not tolerate me to speak with her that way, that I won't be using the restrooms and to take a seat. Sounds pretty personal at this point! Her reaction was unnecessary and all she did is escalate a little restroom situation to where I started yelling at her and pointing out her disgusting behavior. At this point she kept asking me to take a seat and I couldn't because who will take a seat after being spoken to the way she did? Someone without dignity for sure. At this point there's a lot of back and forth going on between us and she then tells me that I will be considered a threat and she will call authorities if I don't take a seat. She was a threat to me by the way she stood up and got in my face and no one in their right mind will tolerate that. At some point I take a seat after my partner comes to calm the situation, I asked her to call authorities.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely terrible experience flying with Alaska. First of all, I’m still on the plane, it is extremely hot on here, and has been since we all loaded. There are no TV’s on the back of the seats like most up to date airlines have. The isles are so small you can’t walk to the bathroom because there’s almost always someone else in the isle already. I paid extra to sit behind first class in the premium seats but the perks that I paid extra for are non existent. I hit the assistance button to have a drink brought to me, but the stewardess told me to walk to the back of the plane if I want a drink. Also, the stewardess is extremely rude, she clearly hates her job and is not welcoming. I asked for milk for my daughter and she said they don’t have milk. How do you carry sodas and juice and all the alcohol but not milk?! We’re going to try and switch our flight with another airline for the flight home because Alaska is so ancient and has been such a let down. Do not recommend. Oh and my seat doesn’t recline. I’m in premium seating, it should recline. My husbands chair reclines but mine is broken I guess.

They said it was the fault of the SeaTac branch and was not their problem. They refused to take any company blame and instead continually tried to push off responsibility and without making any effort to solve a problem. I understand the original problem was created by the SeaTac ticket agent, and they need better training and attention to derail, but the lack of even average customer service at DFW ticket counter really irks me as with just minimal effort on their part, I would at least not be writing poor reviews about Alaskan Airlines.

"✅ Trip Verified | My partner and I were traveling from Seattle back home to San Francisco on 7/16/2023, and I purposefully purchased an earlier flight from Seattle as we were traveling on a Sunday and both of us had work the following morning. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 3:55 PM and was to land at SFO by 6:08 PM. First red flag: Alaska Airlines changed the gate to a completely different part of Seattle's airport last minute. Extremely inconvenient as this was done very close to the alleged boarding time, and Seattle's airport is massive and required several train transfers to reach the new gate. Second red flag: delays without any information. First the flight was delayed from 3:55 PM to 5:02 PM, but no information as to why. Then, the flight was delayed to 6 PM, again no information as to why. Then, 7:40.... 8:10....9:00....9:40....10:00....we finally departed at 10:19 PM (a 6 hour delay) as our airplane was broken and a crew was repairing it for hours. It took over 3 departure time changes for anyone to tell us what was going on, and the Alaskan Airlines representatives were basically unsure as to if we would even be leaving that day as it was ""all up in the air"". Why was there no back up airplane? Why not take an airplane that was scheduled to depart much later in the day/night, and have that flight then use our airplane that was being repaired? Alaska Airlines thought they could mend things by giving us each $100 flight credit to be used for a future flight (which will go to waste as I will never fly with Alaska Airlines again) as well as $24 meal vouchers per person, which if anyone knows the price of airport food then that's enough for maybe 1 sandwich and a drink.

I could not get into the States from Canada to get my flight because I didn't have the ESTA, my kids and husband didn't need one because they are Canadian.

"Not Verified |  Alaska Airlines in my opinion is one of the worst airlines I have ever flown. I was on a 5 hour flight and they don't provide you with a meal. They barely give you a snack. I couldn't get any streaming or even texting capabilities unless I wanted to purchase it for $8.00. Or if I was a member of team mobile! On each flight, they are lacking in overhead luggage space so they ask anyone wanting to check a bag will get the ability to get on the plane in group C. So much of an advantage. They don't seem to take the time to clean the aircraft in-between flights. They barely give you the included beverage. They have no in-flight movies unless you have your own mobile device which I couldn't use for their 700 free movies because I couldn't get into it without paying for streaming, but I was able to get into their commercial. They don't have enough space overhead, but if you don't bring on your own device, you are sitting there with nothing to do for 5 hours because you can't get it on your phone. In fact being on the plane is like one big commercial. They ask you if you want to open up their credit card and all the wonderful things you will get after you accrue 30,000 miles. Then the final thing, your luggage will be there in 20 minutes or we will give you some air miles.

"✅ Trip Verified |  This is my second review. When I was finally able to reach an Alaska Airlines representative by phone and explain the situation, I learned that there was no unaccompanied minor status applied to our child when the reservation was made by phone, contrary to what my husband was told by the airline representative at the time of purchase. I was informed when I was making my complaint that unaccompanied minor status was only paid for and applied at time of check in. Why didn’t the phone representative inform my husband when he placed the reservation? I also learned Alaska Airlines is focused on money more than a minor’s safety. I explained that I had been allowed to accompany my child to the gate for the departing flight and the supervisor I was speaking to exclaimed, “And she didn’t charge you!” I would not have expected to be charged just as I did not expect to fill out a form during check-in because we believed we had paid it as part of the rather expensive ticket we already paid. The supervisor criticized me for not searching out this information on the website. We believed everything was taken care of because we had Spoken to Alaska airline representatives, both when we made the reservation and during check-in. Apparently representative’s words cannot be trusted. Because of the lack of competency on the part of Alaska airlines, our minor child was not met by the guardian at the gate upon arrival. The guardian was not allowed to accompany our minor child through security on the return flight, and was not present as guardian and witness when our minor child was searched all around their privates by TSA. Because of Alaska airlines incompetency, I was not allowed to meet my own child at the gate.

I was supposed to be on first class because I am clausty and have a terrible fear of flying. I realized I was not booked correctly. I reached out to Air to Sea and they said no problem, just download the apps and change seats. On my flight there I was booked on American Airlines. I went on the app, easily upgraded to first class, the staff was super helpful, and they even upgraded my entire family for free! The flight was comfy, the staff on the plane were great, and I had zero panic attacks. Not the same experience with Alaska Airlines. They would not help me. They told me we had plenty up upgrades available and it was a small fee to upgrade. Then the staff said never mind we can't help you because you went through Air to Sea. So we called Air to Sea that said they can't help because the airline does not allow them to see first class. After going back and forth we got both sides on the phone at the same time where Alaska Airlines said they would upgrade us for over $1,000 a ticket! Wow.

✅ Trip Verified |  They damaged a brand new bag I checked in at Kahului and I cannot use the telescopic handle any more. When I pointed this out to their representative Val at Seattle Airport he told me I wasn't entitled to any compensation. After an overnight flight I was too tired to push my case and accepted what he said. But when I arrived at my hotel and emptied the bag to check the mechanism I discovered the mechanism at the bottom of the suitcase bent which has now jammed the handle making it useless. This is obviously from damage from poor handling. Their web site freezes regularly and there is no way to even send them a message to claim compensation or take this matter further.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Aircraft was in poor condition. I paid for a premium seat upgrade, and the seat was super narrow and not worth the extra cost. There was no under seat storage for two of the three seats in my row. The overhead bins are miniscule and they ran out of space before half the plane was boarded. The flight attendants were fairly inattentive to their movements and rammed into me multiple times, despite being fully out of the aisle. When beverage service started i spent a solid 5 minutes with the second seat flight attendant's bum repeatedly being shoved in my face. I understand they have a job to do, but the lack of respect for passengers space is abysmal. The airlines need to consider this when designating aisle space.

"Not Verified | As a first-time flyer, this definitely was a nice introduction to fast travel by airplane. Pros, then cons. Pros 1) Flight boarding time is usually delayed cause airport security or passenger offloading, so if you've arrived with barely an hour to get to the terminal after going through TSA and boarding pass first, you should reasonably make it. 2) Flight attendants are pretty good about making you comfortable 3) Tolerable wait times for taxiing and whatnot. Cons 1) The twin-engine plane (Boeing 737, I believe) economy seating is just enough to be problematic for anyone who has claustrophobia. Additionally, the fold-out for laptops is only big enough for the PC; you want to use a mouse, well, need to use another fold-out on your right. 2) If want additional elbow room, first-class ticket is necessary 3) Lavatories are small enough that anyone significantly fat will feel cramped.

"✅ Trip Verified | Let me start this rant by saying I fly a lot, usually with Delta, but occasionally with AA if they have a quicker route, then transfer to Alaska airline for the last leg of my trip into Nome (Delta doesn’t fly there). I’ve NEVER had any complaints about a flight crew - ever. Instead, I’m the person watching out for the flight crew - completely in awe of the long shifts they work and the kindness they show to each of us. Always grateful for all they do. Like everyone else, often bewildered by the general rudeness of some of the public towards the staff. That was NOT my experience today 1/5/23. Alaska airline flight had a quicker route that sent me through Portland to Anchorage, so I chose it. Because of the amount of miles I fly, I typically get upgraded to first class (even if I don’t purchase). Today, there was no first class seats for purchase, so I ended up sitting in business class, exactly one row behind first class. I was completely fine with that. Again, no complaints. The reason for the rant. I had a horrible experience today. My Alaska airline flight 197 was delayed approx. 1 - 1.5 hours. The flight was originally a late night flight anyway, so this just made things a bit worse, but completely understandable. Things happen. The flight crew can’t control when the plane arrival/departure. However, 3 hours into my delayed flight, while everyone was sound asleep, absolutely no movement at all throughout the plane, complete graveyard silence, I got up to use the restroom and walked to the closest one (literally 5 rows in front of me) in first class. A beautiful blonde flight attendant walked up to me and told me to turn around and go to the restroom in the back. Again, no one was up in the aisles or in line for either restroom. Everyone was asleep. It absolutely floored me - really embarrassed me as the gentleman sitting next to me overheard it and rolled his eyes as I had to turn around. I see people from business class use first class restrooms all the time. I’ve never been offended. I’ve never seen anyone rerouted to the back. Anyway, I went to the back restroom and asked the two flight attendants working the back if there was a policy or some rule that I was unaware of. Minutes later - the two attendants in the back - rushed to the front to ”tell on me”. Then for a absolutely NO reason, they proceeded to make an announcement over the intercom to everyone - instructing non first class people to use the back restroom - mind you - NO one except me was had been or was up moving around. My concern, do they commonly bully people that are not in first class? Do they make a point to try and embarrass customers? The announcement was petty and team bullying. For the first time, I understand why people speak up and confront flight attendants for treating them poorly. I get it. They have you in a position of submission while your traveling. It’s so uncomfortable and sad. I suppose the lesson for me - always fly Delta, but more importantly, be mindful of how people who don’t have the means to fly first class are being treated as they may not be the “rude” passengers I once thought that they were to flight staff.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,Portland to Nome via Anchorage,January 2023,no,   let me start this rant by saying i fly a lot usually with delta but

"✅ Trip Verified | Alaska airlines, we will never fly with you again. All excited to take our daughter who loves flights on her first flight, and the entire experience was absolutely horrible in every way. We let the woman at the gate know it was her first flight and asked if they still got wings and an opportunity to see the cockpit, and the response, ""well it's case by case but I'll tell the flight crew"". Board the flight, no one knew it was her first flight, so whatever we make our way to our seats. Daughter (who just turned two) is now crying because she couldn't see, ok no problem we didn't promise anything to her. We had purchased her a seat so she could have some space, but she only wanted to be held when the plane took off. Still crying and stewardess who was either having a bad day, or clearly has no kids, tells us she ""must be strapped into her own seat"". I explained she was crying and would be better for everyone if we could just comfort her, she gives a nasty look and says ""nope, strap her in"". Wonderful, cue hysterical baby, sorry everyone around us. At this point my child is crying hysterically, borderline throwing up, so we pick her up to comfort her (we were at a stand still on the ground, not even moving or ready for take-off), and here comes stewardess number 2. She clearly sees what's going on and we explain we just need a couple moments to settle her, she looks over at stewardess number 1 who shakes her head, and tells us we have no choice but to strap her in. So I apologize to everyone around us, and my wife and I try to console our hyperventilating daughter who continues to cry inconsolably, till we reach altitude and we are able to rip her out of the seat and settle her. First wave of drinks come out and we are completely disgusted with these woman, and stewardess number one walks over and tosses a set of wings at my wife full of attitude and says ""somebody's first flight eh"". Laughs like she had enjoyed this whole thing. Total train wreck, daughter throws up all over both of us because she was so upset, and no one cared. Another family in the row across from us with a baby was completely disgusted, these two women were acting the way they were. Oh and just to round out the 5+ hour flight from hell, the extremely over-priced wifi I paid for to play a movie and settle our daughter, would not work. It took barely 1 hour of restarts, paid time outs, credit card time outs, and buffering to get it to barely play movie. The movie timed out twice for now reason and when it finally came back the third time the speaking didn't match the peoples mouths. Tried to open a couple games and those wouldn't work because of the wifi either. Several people around us had the same struggles and some asked for refunds and were just left staring at the seat in front of them. Of the hundreds of thousands of miles I have flown, I have never been so disappointed and let down. Pilots who cant be bothered to greet kids. Flight attendants acting angry and vindictive, while also apparently enjoying acting that way. No monitors on a 5+ hour flight and garbage over-priced wifi instead.

"Not Verified |  We had a layover in Seattle on November 29th. Once we got there our second flight was canceled after waiting 2 hours for the delayed flight. The customer service line was extremely long. After about an hour in line I finally reached a customer service agent to help me get my flight changed. By that time there were no available seats on any flights that day, but I had been trying to change my flight while in line and I got a confirmation for a 9pm flight. When I stated that to the rep, she said they had double booked the seat that I was assigned to, but that she will get my on the flight since the other person had not checked in yet. She printed my ticket and handed it to me. After that I asked if there would be any compensation as we were supposed to be home by 12pm and now we had to wait until 9pm for potentially another delayed or canceled flight and this has already been hard on my family. The rep provided no help whatsoever and explained not-so-nicely that because this was not Alaska’s fault, they are not responsible for providing compensation. This made me wonder, what would be considered “their fault”, or is this some fine print that they can get out of any compensation. By this time it had stopped snowing for a couple hours and everything was melted. I couldn’t understand why all other flight carriers were taking off and landing just fine, yet Alaska had to cancel our flight completely. I understood the delay in the de-icing. I asked why it is our fault that Alaska doesn’t have this figured out. Even on the Alaska’s website it stated that they had flights prepared for the upcoming weather and that they had it all figured out. The rep started to get frustrated with me and started getting snarky. She stated that “if we give you compensation, we had to give everyone in this line compensation”. To which I replied “you should”. She continued to ramble about this weather is causing delays and I told her to look outside and I said “what weather?” Again in hadn’t been snowing and I was irritated that this was the excuse when everything was melted and it wasn’t snowing. She yelled at me and stated “Give me back your tickets”. So she was threatening to take my tickets away for the only available flight out for the rest of the day?! I was appalled! I stated “no” you cannot take my tickets. She started getting irate and stated she has been working here for 15 years and that she is working overtime and she shouldn’t even be here, that she should be home. I couldn’t believe she was escalating things as a customer service rep of 15 years, when she should be helping me out. I stated I should be home by now too! I really felt like I was calm throughout the whole conversation and yet she continued to escalate the conversation. At the end of the interaction I stated that “You will be losing a customer, not that you care”. And she said extremely snarky “No, I don’t think we will”. I said “Excuse me, you don’t think you will what?” She reiterated, “I don’t think we will be losing a customer”. What type of rude customer service representative did I just encounter? Is it my problem that she is overworked? I felt attacked and vulnerable as she tried to take away my only way of getting my family home.

I had asked for help three times and was told no! So I said - if I'm required and able to lift a 50 pound suitcase by myself, I will get myself down to the gate since Alaska Airlines is useless. On my way from Anchorage to Boston I took Delta - I had to pay/tip every person who touched the wheelchair - and I still had to pick up my own baggage? I got to the gate myself bumbling through TSA, who wondered why I didn't have help. When I said I was with Alaska Airlines, they won't help - the woman said ""Ah - yes Alaska Airlines, no, they are not much help"" and she proceeded to help me. I arrived at the gate and was immediately pursued by an irate employee asking me loudly my name - and very loudly stating they have to fill out a form for when a customer requests assistance but refuses the wheelchair. I quietly explained the situation, and he continued to chastise me, mimic my words - told him to rip it up. No problems here. He refused. He got louder and more obnoxious. He demanded an explanation - I said, if you're going to make me lift a 50 pound bag by myself, after I kept asking for help - I figure I'll be better off getting myself to the gate. I regret not filing a report on this guy, but I have sympathy because its very difficult to get competent help in Massachusetts or Logan airport. I arrived in Seattle, jumped in their wheelchair and barely made it to the connection. Arrived in Anchorage - there was a rep on the ramp talking on the radio stating he had already requested wheelchairs that were not there. So I didn't bother to hang around. I walked all over the airport and I am in serious pain, I will never depend on Alaska Airlines to help anyone disabled. It works against us and we have to tip everyone so it costs more.

Alaska airlines called our pets by their names and Places boarding pass stickers on their crates with our names and a row of sticker ticket with their names and our names. One would be removed from the carrier before each take off and handed to me letting us know that they are indeed on our plane. Each time we landed a ground crew member would greet us and tell us they saw our cats personally and they have arrived and doing well they once again called them by name and always with a smile.

"Not Verified |  My wife and friends and I enjoyed a beautiful week in Washington on the coast. When it came time to return home we wanted to extend our flight by 1 day. I found what I thought was the toll free number for Alaska Air online. After speaking to a gentleman about the price increase I decided to not purchase it. When we went online to check in, 2 tickers were gone. I immediately called the number back and was informed that they had been canceled on our end. After much arguing back and forth I hung up. My wife and friend had no tickets and we were to fly out the next day. I went back to Google and found a different number to a nice lady in Boise. She informed me that we had been scammed. I asked to have it reversed and she stated, ""there is nothing I can do. We have this a lot. Scammers cancel the tickets and try to get the refund."" I asked why there isn't a verification text or email to confirm the cancelation? Especially if this is something that happens often. She then said we could purchase tickets at a 400% mark up. Having no options, we did just that. Once we got the new tickets we realized they were for our exact original seats.

They say it will be another 20-40 minutes until we can get off the plane (I’m annoyed at this point but recognize it’s almost over I’ll be home soon) 8) This process repeats multiple times. We are told every 20-40 minutes that it will be another “20-40 minutes” and this goes on for approximately 2 hours. During this time, as a consultation they offer us an 8oz middle school milk carton of water? 9) Finally we get a gate, we pull up, everyone starts standing up getting their bags out of overhead and we all start to notice it’s taking a while to open the door (about 15 minutes at this point) and then the announcement comes on that there is “an issue of a large gap between the plane and the hallway thing that connects to the plane” and at this point the plane is turned off, meaning the AC is turned off and we’re forced to sit there for another 25 minutes before finally getting off the plane.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent and professional. We had our children flown to Illinois to visit their sister. They were unaccompanied minor’s. Even though they are 13 and 14 and did not need assistance, we felt better having someone keep an eye on them. From customer service to the ticket agent to the flight attendants, I could not be more pleased. They boarded the plane first with the flight crew and departed the plane last with the flight crew. We were allowed to escort them to their gate and sit with them until they boarded the plane and were in the air. They checked their aunts ID upon arrival and ours when they returned.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a frustrating experience with Alaska. I got a round trip from San Jose to San Diego with my family and among the free items you can check-in are strollers and car seats. On the first flight we were able to check-in for free our son's car seat and wagon-stroller for free. We even called ahead days in advance to ensure we could take our wagon-stroller with us for free. However on the return flight we had to pay to document and check-in the wagon-stroller. The handling of situation was terrible from Alaska. They argued that wagons are not strollers but failed to show any Alaska documentation of their definition of a strollers as ours has seat belts for the kids and can fold to fit the size of large stroller but has a wagon shape. The personnel argued that double strollers were fine but ours was not (even though our could be smaller). We showed them the model on the internet (which states it is a stroller wagon) and even when you search on google for strollers images of this type show on top along the traditional strollers. They argued that allowing us to check-in our ""wagon"" for free during our first flight was a mistake. To make matters even worse, the personnel argued that we use the stroller to carry our stuff which is besides the point as you can do that why any stroller. This suggested to me that Alaska didn't care whether this was a stroller or not and made it harder to actually get an understanding of the rules rooted on Alaska's policies, which Alaska was not able to provide. Along this lines (about not really being helpful) and taking their attitude to a different level, one of the personnel we were having the conversation in order to try to ""solve"" the problem threatened us by saying ""do you want to fly today?"". Not sure what this person was thinking but that only make this experience worse. In the end a more cool headed personnel came in, acknowledged our frustrations and provided a number we can use to complain. This frustrating and unpleasant experience was a result of the poorly documented, inconsistent policies and communication channels at Alaska, and exacerbated by the even worse customer service from Alaska employees at the San Diego airport.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had two very enjoyable flights with Alaska in early July. I had never used Alaska before but after a recommendation from a friend, decided to give them a go. I had just arrived on a 13 hour flight from New Zealand, arriving at LAX and needing an onward flight to SFO. I checked in via a kiosk for the SFO flight and I was lucky enough to be offered a $20 upgrade to First Class which I logically accepted. Everything went seamlessly from check in, right through to priority boarding on the plane which was an Embraer ERJ 175. I was so impressed with the way the First Class team member dealt with a very self obsessed passenger who was demanding a lot of attention in the First Class cabin. At no stage did the team member lose it with this passenger and she remained professional and cordial at all times. I was actually sorry the flight was so short as the service was so good. The flight back on 5th July was on an Airbus A320. Check in was painless but TSA was a nightmare as everyone was flying home after the 4th. We were probably just over an hour late departing. This flight was just as enjoyable, very slick and polished and I have no qualms about using Alaska while flying internally in the US.

"✅ Trip Verified | Alaska Airlines lost 4 customers with how they handled their affairs. My partner's 10 year old son and his friend / guardian were supposed to fly out of PDX, after visiting us for two weeks, on July 13th for a 10 am flight. After they boarded, everyone on the flight got the run around as to why they were delayed and then had to get off the flight and got rebooked for the following day, July 14th for 3pm. For some reason they were told to get off the plane but their luggage somehow made it to Seattle, which was an absolute nightmare because my partners son doesn't live with us, nor his friend, so they didn't have anything as to clothes or toiletries for the next day, except whatever they were wearing. My partner's friend and son waited about 6 hours after the supposed initial take off at the airport due to the delays, with three of those hours getting the run around as to where their luggage is. My partner had to leave work to go pick them up. I get on the phone with Alaska that evening after work to try to find out where their bags are and to get compensation for the whole deal. We told Alaska to not send it back to Portland if they weren't able to get it that night, to just send it to Albuquerque, which they reassured us. They gave us a $50 voucher for each to get underwear, socks, and stuff for the night and told us to call customer care in the morning. I called customer care in the morning and the lady was just God awful, no help what so ever. I asked for a refund on the $60 luggage fee since they didn't get have their luggage and thought that was a fair compensation. We were told Alaska doesn't do refunds and put me back on the phone with baggage. Baggage reassured us that the bags would be in Albuquerque when they landed. Well they landed in Albuquerque to find out that their luggage was sent back to Portland and they will fly it back to deliver it later to their address sometime this week or next week. Seriously? First Alaska delayed their flight until the next day, gave us the run around and we lost work hours, can't give us a straight story on the luggage claim, and when we ask just for the a refund on the $60 luggage fee they so no, we don't do refunds but here's a $50 voucher for a future flight. How about no, we are never flying Alaska Airlines again. I flew Southwest last year and my flight was delayed 4 hours, they gave me a $100 voucher without even asking. Seriously Alaska? You messed up hardcore with the flight being reschedule and losing their luggage and all that was compensated was a $50 voucher with the worst customer service?

"Not Verified |  Their slogan is the ""caring"" airline which is comical as I've never been treated so poorly by flight staff. Was riding with my 3 year old - they refused to give him extra water for his thermos.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I took a day trip to meet an old friend. At the end of the day I returned to the airport for my return trip home. I was seated in the third row at a window seat. A man sat next to me on the aisle seat. He started out the flight being fairly silent. After about a half hour into the flight he started to talk out loud mostly using foul language and moving his arms around in a very erratic way. What was worse was his was coughing and hacking without a mask or covering his mouth. Now this behavior continued through most of the flight. He would take breaks every once in a while but get right back into it. I didn’t even feel safe to drink my water. This guy was spewing all over the place. Many people in the first class cabin were aware of what he was doing and they were disturbed by him. I felt unsafe. I got up to speak to the flight attendant in the front of the cabin. I told the flight attendant that the man was creating a disturbance and that I wanted some relief – seat change perhaps. The flight attendant did not make eye contact with me and barely paid attention to what I was saying. He did say that the flight was full and there was no place to move me. He offered no solutions, didn’t seem the least bit interested in assisting me with the situation. Most importantly he didn’t show any empathy to me about what was happening in the cabin. I tapped him on his upper arm and said – thank you – in a sarcastic manner. He immediately recoiled and said that I hit him and he has a witness. He pointed to a female flight attendant behind me. I said that I didn’t hit him. I then just quietly went back to my seat. Moments later the male flight attendant comes down the aisle and points to me and says that when we land I need to stay in my seat. While he was there pointing to me several people in the cabin spoke up and said that he was missing the point in trying to deflect the problem to me. The flight attendant proceeds to say that there was nothing he could do because the man was not drinking or on drugs.  Also the man had been on an early flight with the same flight crew. They already had experience with this man and thought it was alright to let him get on another flight and sit next to someone. The other passengers in the cabin were telling the flight attendant that they wanted to report the whole issue to customer service. We arrive in Seattle. I sat waiting until they directed me to leave the plane where an Alaska Airline representative and several police were waiting for me. We walked out and at the gate were several of the first class cabin passengers speaking with airline representatives. The group was quite animated and angry. The police directed me to an area where we could talk. I recalled the same story that I’ve written here. The police said they were not going to arrest me. Next up was the Alaska Airlines representative. Who started off his speale with – safety is our first priority and thanked me for being an MVP. Then he went on the say that they would review the situation and perhaps ban me from the airline.

"Not Verified |  I had a flight scheduled from Seattle, WA to Atlanta, Georgia for an important Business trip for 5 days, and i just get a notification that my flight was changed. I look on their website and they cancelled my flight back home! Keep in mind, I booked this flight 1-2 months ago, so I've been prepared. So if i didn't check the change, i would have been stuck in Atlanta! I've been on the phone for about half an hour and the person has been Zero help. My flight to Georgia was on Tuesday, and  I would have flown back home on Saturday, so when i talked to the lady she was going to have me fly back on Sunday, which wouldn't have worked because i have to go to another conference the following week, and we leave on Sunday to go to the other trip.

"✅ Trip Verified | The flight home from Vegas to Seattle and the “customer service” that followed is when it all went to hell. We arrived for our flight nearly 3 hours early. I hate to be late. Our flight was at 11.35 Sunday morning. We arrived at 7.10 am. We grabbed breakfast and everything seemed in order. The flight before ours to Portland left 15 minutes early with no warning and stranded about five people. Our plane to Seattle pulled in and things seemed in order: they loaded the first class and then they made an announcement about the door of the plane not staying open. So there was a delay. But then we noticed them offload the first class, then we noticed them unload our luggage from the plane, they made an announcement that the delay would be an hour, in an hour they delayed it another hour, then another hour, after that they finally announced the cancellation of our flight altogether. It was 5pm at that time. The desk agents were yelling at the passengers over the intercom to stop yelling at them, which I understand but they were not helpful at all. That seems to be the standard with Alaskan Airlines. We made several calls to a customer service only to be transferred so many time until someone pretended not to hear us and hung up on us. They gave us vouchers for taxi to/from the airport to the lodging they set up for us. Firstly, they sent us to the Travelodge in Vegas. Even the taxi driver didn’t want to pull into the parking lot. It was such an unsafe environment (that’s putting it kindly). The desk agent at the motel was so rude. We were exhausted at that point and weren’t even mean to her at all. But she basically threw the room key at us. We went to our room where I slept sitting upright in a chair in front of the door after piling all the luggage in front of the door because door wouldn’t close right. You could see the parking lot through a large gap between the door handle/lock base and the door itself. The door didn’t even lock correctly. There were insects in the tub and running along walls. I cried so hard because I felt so abused by this airline. We paid so much money for our tickets. I will never again fly with them. I am currently on hold with their customer service (right as I write this review) just so I can tell them not to send people to that motel. I have been on hold with them for four hours. Alaskan Airline does not care about its passengers. They’ll take your money and treat you like garbage. Shame on them. Seriously, the worst  experience I have ever had. I’m thankful I made it home.

✅ Trip Verified |  This is the most disappointing flight I have ever flown. I’ve always thought Alaska was decent with customer service but not after this flight. I was asked twice to put my mask on and both times I was greeted by utter anger and disgust. I’ve complied both times because I understand the rules. The problem wasn’t that I had to comply. The problem was that the way they go about accomplishing this is not even remotely nice or courteous in the slightest.

"Not Verified |  Back in September 2021, my wife and I bought a round trip flight to Seattle, WA from Atlanta, GA with our 1 year-old son for Christmas with my family. Our flight details got changed a few times, but it wasn’t a big deal. Our experience at the Atlanta airport was smooth and virtually frustration-free. After we boarded our plane for Seattle, we had to wait about an hour to take off, but it wasn’t a big deal. Our stay in Washington was great, but it was record-cold and we had 10 inches of snow come down. The night before our flight, we tried to change our tickets because we knew we wouldn’t be able to make it to the airport with the snow and black ice. We tried changing them online, but it wouldn’t let us confirm our change of flight. We had Saver tickets, so normally Alaska doesn’t allow those with Saver tickets to change their flights, but they had a flexible travel policy established for the holiday season. Apparently that doesn’t apply to Saver tickets? It was incredibly frustrating. We stayed up nearly all night trying to get a hold of a customer service agent to talk about our situation, but after being on hold for two hours the line automatically hung up on us. So we canceled the flight. What else were we supposed to do? We were given refunds, so we used the money towards tickets a week from our initial return date, but the tickets were twice the price as the originals. Turns out that Alaska canceled our flight only a few hours after we had canceled our tickets. We figured we could call Alaska after the holiday season and get a refund for the extra charge, considering the extenuating circumstances. Anyway, we scheduled our flight for the morning so that it wouldn’t interfere with our 1 year-old son’s bedtime. The day of the flight comes and our morning flight for 9:15am is canceled and we get stuck on a 3:35pm flight. With a 5 hour flight, and a 3 hour time difference, that would put us in Atlanta at 11:15pm or so. This was incredibly frustrating. We got to the airport about 2 hours before our flight was supposed to leave and went to go get our bags checked. We had checked them online, like the email told us to do, so we figured we could print our bag tags from one of the kiosks and be on our merry way. However, it turns out that if you check your bags from home, you can’t use the kiosks to print your tags and you must wait in line to see an agent who can help you check them. We only figured this out after 30 minutes of trying to print our tags at different kiosks and decided to flag down an agent who told us we had to wait in line. Which line? Well, they never told us, so that was fun to figure out. (Side note: Seattle airport is the hub for Alaska Airlines. You would think that it would be a smooth check-in process). We had to wait an hour in that line to get our bags checked. We figure at this point, we’re going to miss our flight because there’s no way we’re going to make it through security in 30 minutes. We couldn’t believe how slow the line was. It took each agent an unholy amount of time to check bags for a single person. It was ludicrous. Fortunately, they did let us skip a big portion of the security line because we had a baby and a stroller. We rush through security and get stopped because of the baby butt paste we had in our son’s diaper bag.

"✅ Trip Verified | Worst flight experience of my life (and I travel for work!). I was traveling SBP-SLO with a flight at 10.45am. Since I had no checked bags (despite traveling with a 1-year-old!) and already had my seat and boarding pass on my phone I arrived at airport an hour ahead of time. Waited in a long security line. Once at front was told I had to go to the check-in counter to print my pass and the printer was broken so I had to wait for some time. Once printed I was told to go back through security. There was a very long line but I made it to the gate 15min ahead of departure time. However, no one was there and once someone was retrieved I was told the door was just closed and they would not reopen. There was only 1x flight on this route per day and the next flight was not until the same time next day. My complaints: No announcement about the flight was heard (or even made?) in the security area. No attempt at all was made to ensure those who had checked in at the airport made the flight (I was not the only one to miss the flight). No apology was made - I was told to either rent a car and drive to Santa Barbara or wait for a flight the next day, which they made sound like I should be thankful they booked for me. No acknowledgement of the airline being at fault for any of this or desire to improve. I called to request a full refund given that I had to rent a car to drive to San Diego that night. They told me I should have canceled the flight that they had rebooked for me 24hr in advance, you mean before the flight was even re-booked? And that booking was made under the pressure of the moment with a screaming 1-year old in my arms while I was trying to consider how to make work the next day?

"Not Verified |  I've been an Alaska Airline member for twenty-three years. I signed up for their credit card with one thought in mind - getting to Australia first-class for a prolonged vacation. My wife and I booked cruise tickets for 2020. Six months beforehand, I tried to get tickets but there were no FC tickets available. I was told I waited too long. So, we delayed the trip (probably a good thing thinking about it) so as to get tickets the day they opened. Lo and behold, no first-class tickets on the very first day I could book travel. This time I was told that I was too early and that they could only release tickets that they were given by partner airlines (eg none). I complained and was politely told that they only had to honor the mile for tickets that were ""available"" which they defined as those given to them. Now, having waited for my grievance to be heard, there are no more coach tickets available. And only on the days that my wife and I want to fly and two days on either side (what a coincidence). What I've been able to glean from case law, the airlines can promise whatever they want and change the rules whenever they want (and the courts back them up). That is almost the textbook definition of bait and switch.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Our seats in first class had been given away. I told her we were checked in at SFO and this was completely unacceptable. She said she only had two seats available at the back of the plane and they were not together. I then asked for a supervisor. The gate manager came over looked at our reservation and attempted to put us on a 10pm flight with another airline she stated “It’s first class and you can be seated together but we can’t guarantee that flight won’t cancel so your other option is to take the seats we assigned then, call the 800 number to discuss a refund and good luck because this is happening with all the airlines”. At this point I became very upset and loudly told her this was not ok and expressed how I felt”. In hindsight I am sorry for my behavior and should not have taken my frustration out on her. She was doing the best she could given the circumstances. In a normal situation I would have cancelled our trip but unfortunately my husband had appointments schedule for the next two weeks in Costa Rica that we could not reschedule. We accepted the seat assignment but we’re not happy. As we were waiting to board I told my husband I was cancelling my credit card. The person who was boarding the passengers very loudly and extremely rudely told me to calm down (I wasn’t talking loudly nor was I even looking or talking to or at her)and would not allow us to board until I calmed down (I again was not showing any signs of anger or frustration).At this point I was near tears and did not reply. I simply walked away. My husband attempted to talk to her and she rudely told him no one is boarding. When I heard this I asked for her supervisor.

I refused to even look engage in conversation with her. This action seemed to infuriate her and she demanded I “look at her while she was talking to me” then a proceeded to threaten not to allow us to board.

The first flight was on time, but the second flight was delay long enough at Portland to result in us being too late to board our ship at 3:00pm(!!) - a cruise that we planned for more than year! Furthermore, when we rescheduled to return home the following day, we were told there were no more 1st class seats available and we will not be refunded the difference - yet when we boarded the plane, there were only two 1st class passengers on the plane!

"✅ Trip Verified |  Alaska airlines ruined or vacation. We spent 4 days dealing with cancelled and delayed flights (I could go on for days with all we had to deal with) and the worst part is that Alaska Airlines didn’t have the staff capacity for us to get all our cancelled flights rebooked. We waited in lines for hours to rebook several flights because they only had 2-3 people working at the customer service desk and when we tried to call to rebook, we never received a call back from them. Some of the employees were helpful and kind but some were extremely rude and clearly stressed. The cherry on top was that they lost our bag with our ski gear in it (the whole point of the trip was to ski) and we still haven’t heard anything back from them about our lost bag (they lost our bag a week and a half ago). Also when we did finally get on a flight is was SO dirty. They clearly do not clean their planes at all.. which is pretty concerning during a pandemic. Attached is a picture of the Lysol wipe I used to clean only my seat.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Review is for customer service person, Rafael. Four friends and I needed extensive help to use credit we had from a cancelled 2020 reservation.

He walked me through multiple steps (including registering for a mileage plan, finding each icon on the website I needed to click on in order to enter credit data and reservation data. He explained the difference between a confirmation number, a certificate code, a certificate pin number, etc. He never lost his temper even though he needed to repeat himself multiple times, and waited for me to complete each step to ensure I was inputting everything properly and navigating to the next step successfully. This took a considerable amount of time, but in the end I was able to rebook our flight for the 5 of us for April 4th from LAX to Portland and return April 10 (on first class) which would not have been possible without Rafael's assistance.

"Not Verified |  The worst costumer service I have experienced flying, we had a horrible experience with our flights. First they changed our flight dates and times 20 times, without a warning or a call. Then on our last flight returning home, we arrive to check-in our bag 1 minute late and they wouldn’t late us get checked in and they made us miss our flight. It’s a policy of the airline so we sort of understood. However the person behind the counter + the manager treated us so badly, they spoke to us in a loud and sassy tone that it was unacceptable. Not only they spoke rudely to us, they wouldn’t help us in any sort of way. We had to wait +10 hours to try to get into another flight which they couldn’t even guarantee until the last minute of the flight boarding. When we went to ask the people on the desk about information on the flight they where even more rude than the ones in the morning. They brushed us off several times, and they even told me not to bother them again with any questions, when of course we were worried it was 1 am with nowhere to stay to sleep if we weren’t able to catch the flight. Not only that, after they kept us with the intrigue of waiting we where finally able to get in the flight. The pilot was horrible, the flight moved like a blender and a lot of passengers were scared, I have been in other flights where the pilot apologizes for the movement and warned in advance for what was coming, everything was taken by a surprise. Also if you ever fly with this airline on a 7 hour flight they won’t pass anything more than a cracker and sell you a cold nasty plate of fruit and cheese so be ready to bring snacks and food.

"✅ Trip Verified |  My family of four was returning from a trip to Seattle (Tuesday) with five checked in bags. Only three made it. That stuff happens in the industry and that is not my complaint. What occurred over the next 36 hours was pure torture with this airline. It started with no one being present to help us report the missing bags. So I used the telephone number and engaged with a very pleasant person who took down all of the information and assigned me an incident number, sending me an email with a portal connection that I could check on the status of the bags. No one contacted me whatsoever during the day and only later at 7:30 PM (Wednesday) did I call them and ask what the status was. It was clear to me that the person that I was speaking with, who was again very pleasant on the phone, was simply a part-time person obviously working from home and had a real disconnect with anyone in the baggage department at Alaska in EWR. In fact, there is no baggage department at Newark Airport for Alaska. They only come on a few minutes before a flight arrival and leave within 10 minutes after the last bag is discharged. All I received were promises that they would reach out to the baggage people when they reported for duty and make sure that the bags were delivered to my home. Every time I spoke with anyone I received the same story. At 1130 the next day (Thursday) I finally was able to reach a manager. I told her that we were now going on 36 hours and I did not see any effort whatsoever by the airline to get the bags back to me. The bags were placed on a later flight and at least I had comfort in knowing that they were in the airport. The manager promised me that she would call when persons were present in the baggage room at 1 o'clock. I did not hear from her and called her at just before 2 o'clock. She admitted that she had not had a chance to call but asked me to be placed on hold and she would call down there right away. After a few minutes she got back on and told me that no one was in the baggage room to pick up the phone. This was standard procedure amongst all personnel. This included a real estate broker working out of Putnam County, New York who apparently is doing customer relations part-time for this airline who sent me an email advising me that they were not responsible for the bags since they were now being held by another airline. I sent her an email asking her to call me but I never did receive a call. She was probably out showing a new listing for a booming real estate business here in the Northeast. All of these people had a chance to make a difference in an individual's life. All of them failed and it is a reflection on this airline that there is no connection between their baggage customer staff and the actual key people that are there 20 minutes before and airline lands and 10 minutes after to work together. It is a major disconnect. I doubt their new CEO will be aware of this. I know that he only took the position as of March of this year. Unfortunately for him, this was my first experience with Alaska Airlines. It will be my last. I will say that the individuals that I spoke to by telephone were all very pleasant but they had absolutely no ability to help me because of the clear disconnect between what they can do and their need to speak with people on the ground that are the real individuals that can help out. In the end, I took the 1 Hour drive back to the airport to get the two bags and will drive the hour back.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,Spokane to Austin,September 2021,no,    my family of four was

✅ Trip Verified |  I was a long time business customer of Alaska and an MVP until they they treated my elderly parents horribly and it makes me sick to my stomach that a company can do this to the elderly and those who need assistance in language and disability as indicated on their ticket. On 9/19/21 my parents were removed from a flight and forced to sleep on the airport floor until I could get them a flight the next morning. My mother was taking a drink for her blood pressure medication and was immediately removed from the flight. She did not in any way refuse to wear a face mask. As a matter of fact she showed it to the flight attendant and told her she was taking medicine (drinking water is allowed). Alaska says the staff was “tired”. Their tickets indicated they needed language and disability assistance. Alaska’s treatment of the elderly and disabled is horrible and I will not stand by it.

"✅ Trip Verified | We boarded a plane home from Costa Rica. When getting in our seats my husband pulled down his mask to communicate to our children where to sit. The flight attendant immediately told my husband to put his mask on, which my husband did. My husband explained he was trying to help our children. The flight attendant then told us we were going to be a problem. This made us uneasy. Right after this another flight attendant started yelling at another passenger about their mask and threatened to extradite the man. At this point I had the worst feeling about the flight. We settled into the flight. My children were doing great and were behaving the best they had on any flight. My son's mask was a little loose. I had given him the 32 degree masks from Costco and they slip. The flight attendant reminded my son to pull up his mask, which he did. Not too long after the flight attendant came to me and told me he had reminded us a lot to put up our masks. My husband told him it had only been two times. The steward began to argue with my husband. I told the steward a firm thank you and he left. At this point I didn't dare rest my eyes. I kept checking my children's masks. My oldest sons mask did slip down again but I would hurry and make sure he had it up. Not once did we ever refuse to wear our masks. Not once were we unruly or trying to be a problem on the flight. We were in the last row of the plane right next to the flight attendant cabin. We could hear them talking bad about the passengers and how awful they were. They seemed really worked up. I then heard the steward say they might have law enforcement waiting for someone at the end of the flight. I heard another female flight attendant say, "" I didn't ask for that to happen."" He responded, ""Well it's done!"" In the back of my mind I was thinking is he talking about us? I quieted my fears and thought it must be the man they had threatened to extradite. By the conversations I was picking up in the back from the flight attendants it seemed like this particular flight attendant really enjoyed the power and was excited to watch seeing someone get kicked off. It was like he could use it at his next gathering of flight attendants where they could tell the crazy stories of what had happened to them. Not okay at the expense of a family just trying to get home with as little problems as possible. Well luckily it wasn't law enforcement, but it was Alaska Airlines employees who handed us a letter that said our connecting flight had been canceled and we are now banned from flying with Alaska Airlines. We tried to tell them that we had tried to comply and that it had been exaggerated, but they wouldn't even let us talk. So here we are a young family of 5, stranded in LA. The same day flights were all $1000 for each family member. We rode a bus to Enterprise who was all out of one way cars. Luckily, there was an amazing employee there. We told him what happened. He got us a van even though he knew he might get in trouble. Honestly, it healed my heart to see someone care after we were treated so badly. We then drove home and arrived safely the next day.

"✅ Trip Verified | Alaska seems to have lost a little quality, going from very good/excellent to good/very good. Not a huge slip in quality, but still noticeable when my prior experiences flying on Alaska have been excellent. The check-in agents in Houston were grumpy and discourteous, not only did not exchange pleasantries with passengers, they just weren't pleasant. On the flight from Houston Bush to Seattle-Tacoma, the jet was dirty and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a couple of days. I say it was the second or third dirtiest jet I've ever flown on. The catering in Houston had dropped the ball on some meals that passengers had ordered, including mine, but the crew offered for me to have another available meal that cost the same, which I accepted - and which was tasty. The crew were polite, focused and professional, but not very friendly. Just robotic. They weren't rude, but they seemed kind of intense, which is something I didn't expect from Alaska. I also purchased in-flight WiFi, which turned out to be slow, it didn't stream the videos I wanted and didn't let me even go a simple Google search. I'm still not happy about that. Now, the flight from Seattle-Tacoma to Portland was better, quicker boarding, much nicer and cleaner plane, much more cheerful and appreciative flight attendants. So, for now, I will continue to fly them when I can and be a Mileage Plus member for the foreseeable future, but Alaska may sadly have lost a slight bit of its way during a pandemic which has required them to reduce service and cut costs otherwise, and it's really a shame.

"✅ Trip Verified |  The customer service lady was a nightmare. I’m disabled and have certified service dog. I had made arrangements for assistance (wheelchair door to plane) before flight. When I went to get my ticket the clerk was rude and disrespectful. She refused to assist me and wasn’t going to let my service dog on the plane with me. She wouldn’t even let me talk or explain anything to me. My trip started with my flight from Houston Texas to Los Angeles California on United. All my flights have always been on United (great experience each time). Somewhere along the way my return flight was changed (American Airlines bought my ticket). I excepted the change, after all I need to get home. That’s why I contacted Alaska Airlines in advance to setup assistance and my service dog information. It was the worst experience I’ve ever had.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Flying back from San Francisco to Los Angeles on a Saturday after a one day work trip, I received an email when I awoke offering me a $250 voucher to change my flight to another day -- I was supposed to fly out at 1030pm after a day of work to get home to see my family and we had plans the following morning. So I naturally ignored the email. Cut to 6pm, when I am informed the 1030pm flight has been canceled and I am flying out the next day at 530pm. After getting on with reservations to change my flight out to 930am the following morning and maybe salvage some of my plans (I couldn't ultimately), I didn't receive a confirmation email about my itinerary. I called back a few hours later and requested it again. Still did not receive an email. Had to call a third time -- it's 1130pm by this point -- and demand an email to be sent while I sat on the phone. However, all that was sent was a receipt, but I was assured I was on the flight. Cut to 8am Sunday, the following morning at SFO and I can't check in at a kiosk. After an hour of standing in line at the zoo in front of the Alaska Air check in stations, I get my boarding passes and am told to call Customer Care (closed till Monday) about being reimbursed for everything I spent while having to stay the extra night in San Francisco. This is important -- I asked how to deal with reimbursement. They told me just to call customer care with no instruction -- all operators, all people I talked to in Alaska air outfits at the airport. So I call customer care. They honor the vouchers they suspiciously sent me earlier in the day on Saturday -- though the operator gets super defensive when I ask why the flight was canceled, she said crew issues, and I ask if they knew that was going to happen with the voucher email -- but demand ALL reimbursements have ITEMIZED receipts. NO ONE told me to do this -- I had receipts for everything but not all of them were itemized. Finally the operator admitted to me that Alaska had limited staff, tons of layoffs, tons of people retiring, etc and it becomes a domino effect down to the customers. However, they still refused to reimburse for the full amount. Despite them canceling the flight. Despite giving zero instruction about how to properly get reimbursed. Despite wasting hours of my time just to get myself home. Dont fly with them until they get their house is in order (that will probably be a while). And if you do, there's a good chance your flight will be canceled -- I'd actually flown with them a month before and they did the same thing, only booked my family on a flight just a few hours later, so it was not a big deal.

"✅ Trip Verified |  When I booked my trip to Hawaii I went to Alaska Airlines and I read through the Alaska Airlines travel guidelines. I was told that I would need to provide a printed out lab result showing a negative COVID, so three days prior and that’s what I did. There was no mention when they took my money for the ticket or even when I took my flight to LA that there was specific trusted locations that Hawaii would only accept. It is only mentioned if you go to a specific link within the site. I was told I could go to Hawaii but I’d be sent home at my own expense or id be forced to quarantine and pay for a hotel for ten days. The manager refused to talk to me when I asked why the information wasn’t more clear on Alaskans website. She said “ there is nothing to discuss and with you.” She turned and mocked me to her employee in front of a group full of people and refused to give me any information on who above her I could speak with. She also said “it’s on me to do my diligence and it rarely happens to other people” even though the website gives you only half the information and is vague I believe on purpose. I was then told I needed to go get another test. The testing site is conveniently right outside the airport and $125.00 on top of that I will need transportation and to stay in a near by hotel without my things and has to rebook my flight for tomorrow. I’ve been told by someone who works for the company that these testing centers are giving 50% or the proceeds back to the airlines and I can only speculate near by hotels and transportation places are also giving a nice kick back or are at least benefiting from the dishonesty. Alaska Airlines during a time when people are struggling and situations are new I’m appalled with the way you’re manager spoke to me and the lack of compassion your employees have for people.

After I complied (I said nothing, just pulled it up), the lady got on the loud speaker and made an announcement while glaring at me while she said it. In addition to that, we were notified at 11.30pm last night that our flight was rerouted 2 hours the opposite direction of where we were going. It was not an easy morning finding that message at 3am when we woke up to leave. At the rerouted airport (Seattle) we were moved from our premium seats to the very last seats on the plane. Also, there are no options to purchase alcohol in the non-premium seats that we already paid for.

"Not Verified |  On Monday morning (05/03/21) I checked my baggage in at Spokane International airport. Alaska Airlines (ASA) accepted my checked baggage and TSA screened and accepted my baggage for airline transportation. One of these items was a box of factory sealed ammunition that weighed approximately 25 pounds. My baggage was transferred to another ASA airplane in Seattle and transported to Juneau where I had a three hour layover after which I would board another ASA flight to my final destination in Sitka. During the boarding process in Sitka, I was called to the ASA customer service desk in the departure lounge. Once at the customer service desk a rather rude customer service agent informed me that my ammunition would not be allowed to travel to Sitka. When I asked why, she stated that the box (baggage) ""had the wrong markings on it"". When I inquired as to what the wrong markings were, she couldn't give me an answer, stating only that an airline baggage handler had said that the markings were wrong. I then assured her that I was well aware of FAA, TSA, and ASA regulations regarding the transportation of ammunition and that my baggage met all of those requirements. About that time she started to become very rude and, with a raised voice, informed me that my baggage didn't meet the requirements. I then asked her to explain to me how it was that both the TSA agents and the ASA customer service agents in Spokane cleared my ammunition for transportation on ASA earlier the same day. She defiantly stated that the people in Spokane were wrong. Following that comment, she stated that I needed to pull my face mask up over my nose, which had slipped down during our conversation. Since the municipality of Juneau owns the airport, it really wasn't her place to try and assert authority over my mask. When questioned further, she stated that I was welcome to exit security, repackage my ammunition and then check it in again for transportation with ASA. I stated that since the flight was already boarding and there was only one flight a day to my residence, that was not a feasible option. After I boarded the plane I placed a call to someone in Juneau to attempt to pick up my ammunition so at least the ASA baggage handler wouldn't get to keep it. The most logical conclusion I can come to is that someone at ASA in Juneau wanted my ammunition and timed the notification to me that it wouldn't be allowed on the flight so that I wouldn't have time to deal with retrieving it. It would be nice if Alaska Air would compensate me for my troubles and $1,000 loss but I won't hold my breath.

"✅ Trip Verified |  San Francisco to New York connecting to Moscow. I don’t recommend Alaska Airlines to anyone. They don’t care about their customers. Due to incompetency of their employees I couldn’t fly home and spend holiday time with my family. I bought non-refundable air ticket because I was flying to the country where I had citizenship and all citizens could enter the country without any restrictions. It was in the very end of December 2020. At the check-in an employee told me I couldn`t go because to enter the country I was going required COVID test. I it was not applicable to me because I have citizenship of that country. Then she called for another employee, they talked and this time they told me I couldn`t go because for the rules of their Alaska Airline to have COVID test to go on board. At the Alaska Airlines website there was no any information that anyone was required any test to go on board. And the first leg of the flight Alaska Airline was to perform was not international, it was from San-Francisco to New-York. I was to change the airline in New-York and proceed internationally. I can`t understand what was the ground for such decision from those employees and where they got this information they didn’t tell me. Sometimes I think they did it for fun. Or it was awful incompetency and irresponsibility. I lost $600 air ticket and Airbnb reservation. My plans to spend holidays with my family were ruined. I came home and wrote a letter Alaska Airlines customer service and asked them to send me the information where it stated that passengers had to have COVID test. They sent me a link where they suggested me to find out myself if I was eligible to fly without test. Following the link I received the information that test WAS NOT necessary for me. I sent them those results. I received apologies and $100 discount for the next travel with them. This is ridiculous, Alaska Airlines!

"✅ Trip Verified |  A sad day today for me. Wish I wasn’t writing this review. Been an Alaska flyer for years now. Have always loved it. Great prices. Great service. Today I don’t think I can ever go back. It’s a principle thing for me. Being a businessman, I highly value how a business treats a customer. We value our customers and put them first in EVERYTHING. Today had one of the most horrendous flights I’ve ever experienced. Halfway through my flight from Honolulu to LAX the flight attendant approached me as my mask was down after just finishing eating some snacks. As if from a hawk from her nest made sure to immediately address my mask being down and almost in a commond said “Put your mask on.” Not a please. Not a “hey sir, you’re our valued customer and you help pay my bills but we have to abide by the law, can you please put your mask on.” It was a “Put your mask on now and I’m not leaving til you do.” kind of a command. Disgusted, I put my mask up, only to find her on the prowl just 3 minutes later to see if I was abiding by her commands. My mask had fell down below my nose just a touch as it does normally when you chew and breathe and sleep on a plane. And she had no problem tapping me on the shoulder to say “Mask up above your nose now. This is your second warning and if I have to come back a 3rd time I will issue a warrant.” At this point I was baffled that humanity has swooped this low. I don’t care if it’s in a pandemic, or a national crisis, when I’m a paying customer there is some degree of customer service and generosity that is expected. No matter how small it might be. I don’t even need her to like me or even act like she likes me. But commanding me to take action like I’m an obedient dog awaiting orders was another level.  I don’t even know what kind of warrant she was referring to, but she surely felt good letting me know she had the authority, power, and pride to do it. Just sad. For me, this is all it takes to have me completely switch over to a different airline and never consider Alaska again. Our family has been faithful members for decades flying first class with the miles that we’ve accumulated and Alaska has finally reached it’s lowest point. I wish it wasn’t just one flight attendant. Because an hour later, yet another attendant came over, tapped me to wake ME up, and asked if the man next to me was apart of our party. I told her no and she reached across me to shake the 70 year old man fast asleep next to me awake and said “SIR, you need to put your mask above your nose.” As if I was absolutely disgusted enough, I wanted to tell this lady off so bad.  COVID has caused good people to completely throw all logic out the window and abandon good manners and any sense of politeness or respect. And it’s all in the “Name of the law.” Look, I get it. You have to follow laws. But why throw out your entire sense of manners and humanity?   To top off the experience, the flight attended left me with a remark that was so loaded with sarcasm and sassiness it was sick.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Diego to Fresno,March 2021,no,    a sad day today for me wish i wasnt writing this review been an alaska flyer for years now have always loved it great prices great service today i dont think i can ever go back its a principle thing for me being a businessman i highly value how a business treats a customer we value our customers and put them first in everything today had one of the most horrendous flights ive ever experienced halfway through my flight from honolulu to lax the flight attendant approached me as my mask was down after just finishing eating some snacks as if from a hawk from her nest made sure to immediately address my mask being down and almost in a commond said put your mask on not a please not a hey sir youre our valued customer and you help pay my bills but we have to abide by the law can you please put your mask on it was a put your mask on now and im not leaving til you do kind of a command disgusted i put my mask up only to find her on the prowl just 3 minutes later to see if i was abiding by her commands my mask had fell down below my nose just a touch as it does normally when you chew and breathe and sleep on a plane and she had no problem tapping me on the shoulder to say mask up above your nose now this is your second warning and if i have to come back a 3rd time i will issue a warrant at this point i was baffled that humanity has swooped this low i dont care if its in a pandemic or a national crisis when im a paying customer there is some degree of customer service and generosity that is expected no matter how small it might be i dont even need her to like me or even act like she likes me but commanding me to take action like im an obedient dog awaiting orders was another level  i dont even know what kind of warrant she was referring to but she surely felt good letting me know she had the authority power and pride to do it just sad for me this is all it takes to have me completely switch over to a different airline and never consider alaska again our family has been faithful members for decades flying first class with the miles that weve accumulated and alaska has finally reached its lowest point i wish it wasnt just one flight attendant because an hour later yet another attendant came over tapped me to wake me up and asked if the man next to me was apart of our party i told her no and she reached across me to shake the 70 year old man fast asleep next to me awake and said sir you need to put your mask above your nose as if i was absolutely disgusted enough i wanted to tell this lady off so bad  covid has caused good people to completely throw all logic out the window and abandon good manners and any sense of politeness or respect and its all in the name of the law look i get it you have to follow laws but why throw out your entire sense of manners and humanity   to top off the experience the flight attended left me with a remark that was so loaded with sarcasm and sassiness it was sick,sad day today wish wasnt writing review alaska flyer years always loved great prices great service today dont think ever go back principle thing businessman highly value business treats customer value customers put first everything today one horrendous flights ive ever experienced halfway flight honolulu lax flight attendant approached mask finishing eating snacks hawk nest made sure immediately address mask almost commond said put mask please hey sir youre valued customer help pay bills abide law please put mask put mask im leaving til kind command disgusted put mask find prowl 3 minutes later see abiding commands mask fell nose touch normally chew breathe sleep plane problem tapping shoulder say mask nose second warning come back 3rd time issue warrant point baffled humanity swooped low dont care pandemic national crisis im paying customer degree customer service generosity expected matter small might dont even need like even act like likes commanding take action like im obedient dog awaiting orders another level dont even know kind warrant referring surely felt good letting know authority power pride sad takes completely switch different airline never consider alaska family faithful members decades flying first class miles weve accumulated alaska finally reached lowest point wish wasnt one flight attendant hour later yet another attendant came tapped wake asked man next apart party told reached across shake 70 year old man fast asleep next awake said sir need put mask nose absolutely disgusted enough wanted tell lady bad covid caused good people completely throw logic window abandon good manners sense politeness respect name law look get follow laws throw entire sense manners humanity top experience flight attended left remark loaded sarcasm sassiness sick,NEG

"Not Verified |  Worst experience of my life. I have always supported Alaska, but never again. On our Feb 13th flight to Orlando, it was nothing but a poor show. First, the flight was boarded on time. After around 45 minutes, they deplaned and claimed there were no pilots. Then why did you board the plane? I understand delays when there is winter weather, but it was pretty odd that they boarded anyway. The pilots then arrived about two hours late. Everyone cheered and they got ready to board! Not even 30 seconds later, the Alaska Airlines app notified us the flight was cancelled? My boyfriend ran to the counter to ask to switch to a new flight and asked “is our flight really cancelled?” The flight attendant said “what? I don’t think so?” They didn’t even know before it was announced? The pilots said they were ready to fly it. Then, everyone was frantic and running to the counter. We were told it was cancelled because the pilots were too late. Okay, fair enough. We were then booked on a flight days later that had a huge layover in San Diego. We took it upon ourselves to book a new flight that night on Delta. Flash forward one week, and one of our travelers with us had their Alaska Airlines flight home to Seattle cancelled without her knowledge because she was a “no show.” What? To add insult to injury, we had to spend more than $500 extra each to get to our destination, and they offered her a $100 voucher only and claimed the original flight was cancelled for weather when that was not what we were told, that’s suspicious.

I was up early, went through the TSA checkpoint in a somewhat timely manner and grabbed a cup of coffee at the Alaska Lounge. We departed on-time as has been the case with most of my Alaska flights. I sat next to a fellow who had been an F-4 jock back in the day and we spent much of the flight swapping war stories. The flight itself was fine, the crew was great, personable, professional and pleasant to deal with. We arrived on time. I then eventually found my AA flight to Springfield. Had a great time with my uncle, celebrating his 90 years. The return trips were great. I flew in First on three of the four Alaska legs and really had no complaints other than the breakfast meal I had pre-ordered was not available, I had the fruit and cheese choice which is fine with me anytime. Again, I landed in Seattle on-time and back to the hotel to break up the long day. Off to SEATAC the next morning and spent 3 hours at the Alaska Lounge watching the airport activity and drinking some great coffee. Our flight back up to Anchorage was great for me, the fellow next to me was not a happy camper though, he did not get what he ordered for breakfast and vowed never to fly Alaska again. I tried to tell him that things are different now thanks to Covid-19 and we all need to adjust a bit in regards to changes. He was not going to change his mind though. I guess I am just lucky in regards to my flights on Alaska. I read other trip reports on this forum giving very low ratings and I cannot believe what I am reading.

On our flight down to San Diego, the middle seats were not empty. I was in row with two strangers. And one of my sisters was in a row with two strangers. The flight attendants came on the speaker to say “This flight is overbooked. You may be sitting 3 to a row with people not in your family. If this makes you uncomfortable we will put you on the next flight out”. Given this, I called Alaska to ask that I be put back on the 9:30 flight, since they are booking out the middle seats, I could easily sit in one row with two of my sisters. To prevent others from sitting next to strangers. They wouldn’t do that. They would rather have my sisters sit on a flight three to a row, next to strangers, than next to their own sister, who paid to be on that Flight in the first place. I then asked to be changed to the 7:30 am flight so I wouldn’t have to fly out so early. They told me I would have to pay $50 to do that. But there are no change fees on Alaska Airlines, and this 7:30 flight was going for the SAME price I paid for my original ticket (keep in mind I paid in part for the ticket using miles so I couldn’t just cancel and rebook).

No matter how many times I said we had not, and in fact had gotten a confirmation instead. For the record, had we waiting to check in at the airport, we wouldn’t have gotten the 1 comparable flight that day. We rebooked BUR-SEA.  As we walked on, they announced the back lav sink is broken, the WiFi is broken and the stewardess did a grumpy-dad-glovebox number on two of the overhead cabinets.

"Not Verified | Due to Covid-19 my flight from Anchorage was changed which is understandable, a lot has had to change. However when I got to ANA I was told I did not have a seat on the flight they changed my earlier flight to. I had a seat on my connecting flight in Seattle but flight AS106 out of Anchorage was full, without me, even though they were the ones that changed my flight. So they booked me on yet another flight, 3 hrs later. I was told to check at the gate if there was a no show on the earlier flight (AS106) if so I could get on. Well there was a seat available, but the young man at the gate would not let me have the seat. So the plane left with an empty seat and I had to wait another 3 hours for the next flight.

"Not Verified | Worst airline in the past 10 years! I understand that these times are difficult for everyone. My flight was changed by the airlines at least 7 times by the airlines in a 2 month period. I get it. The problem was that I was never contacted by the airlines to see how these changes worked with my schedule. There were 5 people traveling together to a remote Alaskan fishing lodge with a tight schedule and limited access to this isolated facility. These changes were never communicated to me or asked which option benefited me rather than the airline random movement. I had also misplaced my driver’s license upon arrival in Seattle for a long layover before continuing to my final destination. I contacted TSA to make I would have the needed material for departure and satisfied them. When I contacted Alaskan to make sure we were good, I was told it would be an additional $200 expense since they had to add two additional sentences to my ticket. This is only a chance to grab more money. I refused to pay and ultimately got on the plane. This was nothing more than an attempt by Alaska Airline to “stick it” to their clients when it was not even necessary. On the return home flight, we had a 45 minute lay over in Seattle between connections. We landed on time and could not get the gate because a plane was at the gate. We let the flight attendant know that we had 5 people making a tight connection and another party of 15 was also trying to make a tight connection to Sacramento. Once we made it off the plane and to a neighboring gate, the Alaska Airlines flight was at the gate and not pulled away. They refused to let us on our flight and would not let us speak to a supervisor. The other group had the flight held for them and made their connection. There was never any effort by Alaskan to provide services to their clients, but rather they did what benefited the airlines only. Custom service, I felt is not a priority for Alaska Airlines.

"Not Verified |  First off let me say that, in my opinion, Alaska is trying hard during these unusual times. My route changed from BWI direct to SEA to PIT then on to SEA. This was not a big deal as we landed, a few folks got off and a few got on. The flight was only about 45 minutes and we were on the ground less than 20. The crew told us to please wear your masks at all times except when eating or drinking and everyone complied. I was moved up to First, one row in front of where I had been sitting. The service was fine but the ""food"" left a lot to be desired. It was some sort of small box with not much in the way of food inside. As I recall there were chips, crackers, smoked creamy cheese and small salami pieces within. I managed to eat it all but did enjoy the wine with it. The First Class FA made the trip very enjoyable. After serving everyone, she came and sat with me for a little while and we shared our love of aviation over the years. From what I saw, the rest of the crew was top notch as well. The pilots got us to SEA a little early and I then relaxed in the Alaska Lounge for two hours before catching the flight home to ANC. No problems noted as that crew was professional and we were well cared for. All in all, I still enjoy this airline and eventually when all these troubles are over, it will then be able to provide their old, reliable level of service which they were known for. I do look forward to that.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Santa Ana,July 2020,noClose,first off let me say that in my opinion alaska is trying hard during these unusual times my route changed from bwi direct to sea to pit then on to sea this was not a big deal as we landed a few folks got off and a few got on the flight was only about 45 minutes and we were on the ground less than 20 the crew told us to please wear your masks at all times except when eating or drinking and everyone complied i was moved up to first one row in front of where i had been sitting the service was fine but the food left a lot to be desired it was some sort of small box with not much in the way of food inside as i recall there were chips crackers smoked creamy cheese and small salami pieces within i managed to eat it all but did enjoy the wine with it the first class fa made the trip very enjoyable after serving everyone she came and sat with me for a little while and we shared our love of aviation over the years from what i saw the rest of the crew was top notch as well the pilots got us to sea a little early and i then relaxed in the alaska lounge for two hours before catching the flight home to anc no problems noted as that crew was professional and we were well cared for all in all i still enjoy this airline and eventually when all these troubles are over it will then be able to provide their old reliable level of service which they were known for i do look forward to that,first let say opinion alaska trying hard unusual times route changed bwi direct sea pit sea big deal landed folks got got flight 45 minutes ground less 20 crew told us please wear masks times except eating drinking everyone complied moved first one row front sitting service fine food left lot desired sort small box much way food inside recall chips crackers smoked creamy cheese small salami pieces within managed eat enjoy wine first class fa made trip enjoyable serving everyone came sat little shared love aviation years saw rest crew top notch well pilots got us sea little early relaxed alaska lounge two hours catching flight home anc problems noted crew professional well cared still enjoy airline eventually troubles able provide old reliable level service known look forward,POS
"✅ Trip Verified |  Most of us appreciate the fact that during this pandemic we live with uncertainty and risk. I accept this, but take reasonable precautions to stay safe. With this in mind I choose Alaska for a recent flight from Portland to Orange County. My risk analysis was heavily influenced by the airline’s stated policy that passengers would be seated with an open seat next them, thereby significantly reducing the density of people, and creating more space between passengers. Separate seats were booked for myself and three other family members. We were all a bit nervous about the prospect of being in a confined space with strangers during Covid times, but took solace in the promise that the airline had a safety policy of spacing people and reducing overall passenger density. I calculated that my family’s “bubble” would be a space of four rows (the plane has two seats per row). We’d each have the option of sitting adjacent to the window, with an empty seat between us and the aisle. Imagine my disappointment when the boarding agent scanned my ticket and informed me that our seats were changed. Alaska had unilaterally decided that we were a group that must be packed in side by side. This was the case for many other travelers on this plane. Mandatory reseating. End result: a very full plane, zero personal space for those sitting in the aisle, more people impacting the restroom, more people in line, more hands on the fixtures, more risk for my family. And one more thing: more profit for Alaska Airlines. My decision to take this flight was a calculated risk. I weighed the facts based on what I thought was an honest agreement between me and the airlines regarding personal space and overall airplane density. I feel duped. When boarding, I told the agent we do not want to be reseated in a tighter cluster. The response: “sorry sir, we need to make room for more people”. Thank you Alaska for reorienting me on your company’s policy: profits over customer safety. I appreciate that airlines are struggling more than most businesses to financially survive the COVID crisis. But I do not appreciate being mislead. Airlines have a responsibility for their customer’s safety, and a moral responsibility to honest and transparent when communicating their policies.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Alaska airlines gives disgruntled passengers air miles for lost luggage, an unsatisfying experience and a plethora of other reasons - am I right? They use air miles as a retention tool, because giving a passenger air miles doesn't monetarily cost them anything. I recently used 160,000 air miles - which I earned with my butt in an Alaska Airline seat - to travel to Spain in May 2020. Although the hotels were non-refundable, I purchased a travel protection program, which informed me my miles would be refundable should I not be able to travel due to a health related issue. Then, COVID-19 hit. Delta airlines, with whom I had non-refundable tickets - issued me a full monetary refund. Two hotels in Spain, for which I had non-refundable reservations, refunded me. Alaska Airlines has refused. The only refund I requested of Alaska Airlines is the air miles I used to ""purchase"" the hotels. When you use air miles for hotels, you also have to spend a very small portion of money, which I did, and which I did not ask for a refund. I was willing to lose the $500 dollars, but not my air miles. What has been the answer of Alaska Airlines? ""I'm sorry Sir, there is nothing we can do.""  What I now believe is that Alaska Airlines cares more about their short-term pain than the longer term gain of ensuring client retention.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I am truly outraged at the lack of compassion and professionalism  during my flight home on February 2, 2020 from Phoenix to Anchorage. When my husband booked our flights he called Alaska Airlines and followed their directions of booking us together on all flights and booking a different flight when he advised he would have to fly to Dallas from Phoenix. When we checked in, about three hours early and had the attention of the counter agent, who we advised my husband was not flying with me on our companion airfare. The agent said, “That was not a problem as we had paid for both seats.” As I was in boot casts on both feet, and having to use crutches to walk, the agent gave my husband a boarding pass telling him that way he could escort me to the gate helping with my carry-on. he also gave my husband directions to board Spirit Airlines which was located in a different terminal. After boarding the flight, which was quite a challenge being in the condition I was in, and the doors closed and ready for takeoff, I was approached and made to feel like I was some kind of thief and forced to leave the flight. I was told that because I was not the primary flyer on the companion airfare I could not continue on the flight as my husband was not with me. I explained that the companion airfare was from the same credit card I was an account holder on. I was told I was going to have to buy a full fare ticket, to which I asked to buy the seat I was sitting in and not be removed from the flight. I was told that was not going to happen and I had to get up and leave this flight and I would not be flying on this plane.  I was forced to de-board in Phoenix, from a direct flight to Anchorage, with a long layover with no offer of assistance. I cannot explain how vulnerable, alone, and at risk I felt during that six hours before I could board another flight, which I paid for with the same credit card the companion airfare was purchased on. Then I had to deboard and navigate the Seattle airport for a long layover, on crutches, with a heavy carry-on, with no offer of assistance to or from the gate. I was told on flight 115, before I was forced to deboard, that I had to be the primary flyer, and since been told the same. Why didn’t the individual my husband talked to when he called and booked the flights tell him the same, why didn’t the agent advise the change when we checked in? Why was I not allowed to purchase my seat on flight 115? My husband booked his return flight to Anchorage from Dallas on Alaska Airlines, and he just purchased tickets in March to Phoenix on Alaska Airlines. Alaska Airlines has almost exclusively been our airline of choice as noted by the almost 600K airlines miles we have on our credit card. So many opportunities for Alaska Airlines to be compassionate and to have put yourself in my shoes and help, but the agent that removed me from the flight was very short with me, rude in how she spoke with me, and would not listen or work with me at all.

He didn't give a reason this time. 3hrs after our scheduled departure, we were finally allowed to board. But once on board, the pilot came on and said the flight would be delayed again due to slow ground handling staff. We didn't depart until 4hrs after our scheduled departure.

"✅ Trip Verified | Honolulu to Dallas/Fort Worth via Seattle. While US-based airlines often lag behind their international counterparts in terms of providing modern amenities and efficient and pleasant customer service, it has been my experience that Alaska is one of the better US-based airlines. I've flown them over the last five years and always have had positive experiences. Their economy seats aren't exactly luxurious, but their planes have always been extremely clean. Their flights, sans their puddle-jumper ones, usually have a great assortment of on-flight entertainment. Staff, whether at check-in, the gate, or on the plane, are almost always pleasant, courteous, helpful, and professional. The only exception was the gruff and rather odd check-in agent in Honolulu (no surprise, it's a terrible airport with miserable staff) who was skeptical about accepting my checked bag because of something on my boarding pass that he couldn't really articulate, but, nevertheless, he demanded to see my driver's license. I have no idea what that was all about and what his problem was, since I entered my name, address and TSA Pre-Check details correctly when I booked the flight. Otherwise, the check-in processes, whether online or at the airport, are normally efficient. The one time I was delayed on Alaska, about three years ago, the staff handled passenger inquiries with class and professionalism - much more so than I would expect on airlines such as United, American, Spirit, and Southwest. Their prices are often competitive with the likes of United and Southwest, especially for West Coast flights. It's a shame that Alaska focuses primarily on the West Coast, plus Chicago, Dallas and New York, because, based on my experiences, they'd be a great travel host for foreigners touring the U.S. Just try to avoid the odd check-in dude in Honolulu.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Juneau to Las Vegas via Seattle,January 2020,no,   honolulu to dallasfort worth via seattle while usbased airlines often lag behind their international counterparts in terms of providing modern amenities and efficient and pleasant customer service it has been my experience that alaska is one of the better usbased airlines ive flown them over the last five years and always have had positive experiences their economy seats arent exactly luxurious but their planes have always been extremely clean their flights sans their puddlejumper ones usually have a great assortment of onflight entertainment staff whether at checkin the gate or on the plane are almost always pleasant courteous helpful and professional the only exception was the gruff and rather odd checkin agent in honolulu no surprise its a terrible airport with miserable staff who was skeptical about accepting my checked bag because of something on my boarding pass that he couldnt really articulate but nevertheless he demanded to see my drivers license i have no idea what that was all about and what his problem was since i entered my name address and tsa precheck details correctly when i booked the flight otherwise the checkin processes whether online or at the airport are normally efficient the one time i was delayed on alaska about three years ago the staff handled passenger inquiries with class and professionalism  much more so than i would expect on airlines such as united american spirit and southwest their prices are often competitive with the likes of united and southwest especially for west coast flights its a shame that alaska focuses primarily on the west coast plus chicago dallas and new york because based on my experiences theyd be a great travel host for foreigners touring the us just try to avoid the odd checkin dude in honolulu,honolulu dallasfort worth via seattle usbased airlines often lag behind international counterparts terms providing modern amenities efficient pleasant customer service experience alaska one better usbased airlines ive flown last five years always positive experiences economy seats arent exactly luxurious planes always extremely clean flights sans puddlejumper ones usually great assortment onflight entertainment staff whether checkin gate plane almost always pleasant courteous helpful professional exception gruff rather odd checkin agent honolulu surprise terrible airport miserable staff skeptical accepting checked bag something boarding pass couldnt really articulate nevertheless demanded see drivers license idea problem since entered name address tsa precheck details correctly booked flight otherwise checkin processes whether online airport normally efficient one time delayed alaska three years ago staff handled passenger inquiries class professionalism much would expect airlines united american spirit southwest prices often competitive likes united southwest especially west coast flights shame alaska focuses primarily west coast plus chicago dallas new york based experiences theyd great travel host foreigners touring us try avoid odd checkin dude honolulu,POS

"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight from Oklahoma City to Seattle was sub-par. Decent service but poor internet service. My nightmare came true after boarding my connecting flight to Pullman. After everyone had boarded, the captain came over the intercom to announce the flight was cancelled due to weather. So we deplaned, and were advised to go to the customer service desk near the gate. Low and behold, there was a long line. It took me roughly 90min to get to the front of the line. During that 90min wait, I was automatically rebooked to the same flight the next day, which I was not about to risk another cancellation. When it was my turn to get helped, the agent said there was no other alternative. He ""claimed"" all nonstop flights to Spokane were overbooked, Spokane via Portland and/or Boise were sold out. I did a search on the Alaska Air app and saw he wasn't telling the truth. I saw there was room in economy on a Seattle-Portland-Spokane flight, and he wouldn't rebook me to those flights because it was ""inaccurate"". He told me to take my current rebooking or leave it in the rudest tone. They wouldn't even accommodate a hotel reservation, and expected me to wait in the airport for over 24hrs to board the flight I was rebooked on again. I wasn't about to do that, so I reserved a room at a nearby hotel. I didn't leave the airport until almost 2am at this point on Xmas Eve. At the hotel, I was given the number for customer care by a very nice woman. I called, requested a call back due to extended wait times. I was called back, and the agent was very helpful. I told him what I've experienced, how aggravated I was and how the agent at the airport couldn't rebook me because of inaccuracy. Surprisingly, he was very sympathetic about how I didn't want to risk getting on the same flight and have it cancelled again. He went above and beyond by getting me on a seat on a late morning Spokane flight in first class. I was thankful for his generosity. I still have a flight from Pullman to Oklahoma City via Seattle I need to take after New Years. However, regardless of what I experience during that trip (hopefully nothing like what I experienced on the way to Pullman), I'm very certain I will never fly Alaska again after what I experienced.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Lihue to Medford via Portland. 30 hours and counting still not sure if we are going to make it home. In Lihue, Kauai our plane needed a fuel filter. We sat with two children (3 and 6 y.o) for a 4 hour delay. Boarded the plane then the only tug broke down after hooking up to our plane. Sat for another hour. These delays caused us to miss our connections. We were told our hotel vouchers would be awaiting us in Portland. After landing at 115 a.m the Alaska desks were a ghost town. We finally found someone to help at baggage desk. We were booked on the 7 am flight next day, given cab vouchers, and a hotel room. The cab vouchers were for a company that does not run 3 am, we had to uber. Before we left another employee calls us back to the desk to inform us the 7am flight had been canceled due to lack of a crew so our only option was 4PM or 630p.m!

"Not Verified |  After a fiasco with an original flight that was missed due to a traffic accident that closed the road, I was able to book a later flight to Las Vegas. In Anchorage they asked for volunteers to check their carryons to reduce the weight. Since I was grateful that Alaska Airlines was able to get me another flight that day, I gave them mine.

They put it on a flight to Seattle instead.

"Not Verified | Los Angeles to Edmonton via Seattle. Figure out your logistics. Having a plane land 10 minutes after boarding call on the next connecting flight is the stupidest thing I’ve ever witnessed during a flight. I had to run as fast as I could to go three terminals over in Seattle to make it. So many people missed the flight that the weight distribution had to be recalculated and signed off prior to taking off. If enough time was given for these patrons to make the flight, we would have been less delayed. Also, I booked a one-way flight but ended up on one with a transfer.

"✅ Trip Verified | San Jose to San Diego. They aren't what they used to be. Early morning flight delayed 2 hours. No email, text or notification by app was given. First explanation was that pilots needed to have a mandatory 2 hr break from their list flight, then the explanation was the pilots flew into a different airport and needed to be transported. Our flight attendant said he thought it had to do with the hotel they all stayed at needing to be evacuated the night before. Whatever really happened lies were told regardless. The common courtesy I expect for delayed flights would be to notify passengers of the delay ahead of time, but Alaska didn't seem interested in this. No email, no text, no app updates. I only learned of the 2 hr delay once I got through TSA. The store notification I did receive was that boarding began 30 mins before the notification was sent (received at 0745 that boarding will start at 0715) and new flight time was issued (0755). Wasn't even close to what happened. Only started boarding 10 mins after the original delayed boarding time at 0805.

"✅ Trip Verified | Pasco to Maui via Seattle. My son was asked if he wanted to go to Hawaii a few weeks ago. His best friend's parents were taking him to Hawaii as a graduation present from the year before and his girlfriend was going to go with him. She purchased her ticket back in March, and then because of school issues, was not able to go, so they asked my son if he would be willing to pay the $125 change fee and go with to Hawaii. Being a 17 year old, he was in. When she (girlfriend) called back on the 16th of August to make the change, the agent informed her that there is an additional $223 fare change fee on top of that. Being she was an 18-year-old going to college Freshman, she was shocked and paid the fees without consulting anyone. She then contacted my 17-year-old son to let him know about the additional fee. So on top of the $680 ticket, there is now a $125 fee change fee, a $223 fare difference fee, and he didn't know what to do because it was already a done deal. I told them not to worry and I would give customer service a call. I got a lot of run around talk. I heard a lot of ""there is nothing we can do""! I asked if this was purely company policy and they said yes. I asked to speak to a manager that had the authority to make changes, and I was put in touch with her. She said, ""There is nothing I can do!"" I asked her if that was a company policy or the law. She said company policy. I said, then don't tell me there is nothing you can do, tell me there is nothing you are willing to do. I get it that there are people out there that will try and take advantage of a company and manipulate the system. I am wondering, however, why a $960 million dollar company is excited to take advantage of an 18-year-old Freshman going to college, and a 17-year-old senior in high school, why would I ever fly them again? The sad part is, I had a bad experience with them 4 years ago when my daughter was a part of the State Sports Committee and needed to change a flight, they were no different. Gouging teenagers that had valid reasons to change tickets, that Alaska Airlines already owned. It's not like they were out anything, they just needed to change a name. Instead of this person flying, this other person is flying. They tried to make us feel better because apparently we should have been charged (2) $125 change fees plus the airfare difference and they only charged us one. Well, I hope this helped build the shareholder confidence in your company because I will do everything within my power to not fly Alaska and never get your credit card. Thanks for taking advantage of a 17 & 18-year-old innocence. I hope you sleep well at night knowing you just made 2 teenage lives that much harder due to the fact they both had to pay their own way to make this happen.

Not Verified |  I booked a flight in April to attend my 35th class reunion in June. It was going to be a quick weekend trip back home. About 3 weeks before my trip I found out my mother (who I was going to be staying with) was diagnosed with cancer. I needed to fly out sooner than I thought so I called Alaska to see if I could change my flight. The customer service rep was very kind and pleasant. She told me there would be a hefty charge to change flights and the flight I wanted to change to was an additional $85. Without skipping a beat the rep waived the charge for the switch! I was blown away! My flight was excellent and I had a wonderful time with my mother and at the reunion. My flight home was just incredible as well! I got to my gate early thanks to me somehow getting TSA precheck on my boarding pass. While at the gate the agents asked if anyone would like to check their carry on since the flight was full. I went ahead and checked my carry on for no additional charge. As I waited to board one of the agents called my name and gave me my new boarding pass. They had changed my seat to business class (I was originally in row 20!) I never asked for preferential treatment! Needless to say I was thrilled with my new seat and the flight attendants were friendly and welcoming.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Seattle to San Francisco. Do not fly with Alaska Airlines, their staff shortages made us miss our flights. We arrived nice and early to Seattle airport for a short hop to San Francisco onwards to Manchester, UK. We were first told to wait for the kiosks to check into our flight (check-in on-line was unavailable the night before) Once we had finished on the kiosks a ticked was issued saying our passports would need to be checked. We were then told we needed to stand in the “Assistance” lane. This lane was filled with every man and his dog (literally) there were 5 desks serving on the line we were in - only 2 of the 5 were occupied with staff (this was Memorial Weekend). The line moved very slowly as every person in this general assistance line had a long issue to resolve for example not having a Canadian eTa People we’re dropping out of this line like flies as they to were missing their flights due to incompetence from Alaska airways with regard to staffing levels on such a busy weekend. When we eventually got to the front of the queue after nearly 2 hours we had missed our first flight to San Francisco. I asked if a later flight was available at first the lovely and very apologetic staff member said yes and then made a call. After that call she was told us she was told to tell us we needed to call Condor/Thomas Cook to get us a new connecting flight as our flights were originally booked with them. After 20 minutes on hold Condor/Thomas Cook told us that it was ALASKA Airways would need to book us on to the new flights. By this time we had now missed that next available flight We were forced with either a $7000 economy flight later that day with another airline or fly home the next day from Vancouver which was a 4 hour taxi/coach ride away for $1400 total (including extra hotel stay). Our Tavel insurance would not cover the additional cost as airline incompetence is not covered. I complained to Alaska Airways who offered a $50 discount per person on flights with them.

She noticed we were out of breath from running from the rental car area to the checkout to make our flight. She said we were very close to the cutoff time. I agreed and said we needed to check two bags and get our boarding passes. She proceeded to ask whether or not I had checked in online. I confirmed I had. She then asked where my boarding passes were, then. I explained i did not have a printer to print them out. She then tried to explain that meant I had not officially checked in for the flight. In order to speed things up I tried to have her focus on getting the bags checked and the boarding passes printed. She said, again, we were close the cutoff and the bags might not make it. I told her that was fine, we just needed to make the flight. The bags could show up the next day. She then said we missed the cutoff and the only way to get on the flight now was to call the gate and ask if they would allow us. I said ""please call them, then."" She very slowly looked up the number, then called, and then I could hear her say ""you can't let some late passengers through at this point, can you?"" I was dumbfounded. She looked at me and said the gate agents would not permit us to go through. We were still 30 minutes away from the departure time. We had TSA precheck, so we would have made it through the security in 5 minutes. We would have easily made the boarding process. I then moved to a different ticket agent. He was prepared to help. He said we were now past the cutoff time and he would have to call the gate agents. he was starting to call when the first lady walked over to him and explained how she had already called and there was nothing they could do.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Santa Ana to Seattle. Alaska has been my least favorite airline, and I was concerned when I realized that’s who my husband had booked our trip through. It’s highly irritating that they charge for every checked bag. Our flight was delayed 3 hours due to a previous passenger having flushed a diaper down the toilet, which disabled the entire lavatory system. I realize this issue was out of their hands. When we finally boarded three hours late, my baby, who’d been sleeping and or calm during what should’ve been the entire flight, had absolutely had it. She started fussing, and the youngest woman of our flight attendants started joking with the passengers in front of us that they were all going to need a drink for this flight. I wanted to turn her snack cart over. Are you serious. Later, the same flight attendant stooped down to talk to my baby and said, “You seem happier now, you sure weren’t happy a little while ago!”. Then she conversed with the woman in front of me, sharing that another passenger had been rude to her about the situation, and said, “If you talk to me like that, I’m not going to give you anything, but if you’re nice about it, I will.” She then made a big show about how the seats in front of us were all premium seats which were entitled to free snacks and alcoholic beverages. When people have been stranded at the airport for 3 additional hours due to mechanical issues, the handful of people who were unable to switch flights, and had to struggle on should all get free snacks at the very  least.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to Honolulu. I've flown on Alaska air several times. This last time was by far the worst. I booked a first class ticket and was bumped to premium class, because they don't allow more than one pet in first class. I made sure to ask before I even booked my ticket.

The worst part is that it's been almost a month, and I still haven't heard from customer service regarding the refund I've requested for the price difference between first class and premium.

The flight attendants were speaking so loudly in their personal conversations that I could hear nothing else even over at the roar of the jet engines.

Also, deboarding the plane was not organized and did not happen in a timely manner.

"✅ Trip Verified |  My recent travel with Alaska Airlines has been an incredibly frustrating experience. My family (3yo, 8yo and two parents) were travelling from Bellingham via SeaTac to Orange County. We were delayed in getting there, and cancelled many times coming back due to weather. Alaska typically cancelled with short to no notice (even after a five hour wait at the airport) and rescheduled us to flights that were undesirable. We finally got home (three days after schedule) on another airline and by renting a car because Alaska wasn't able to get us to our destination. After coming home attempting to get a refund for the flight we never took was next to impossible. Every time I called the person on the phone said the previous agent hadn't done what they needed to do and my file had gone nowhere. I've had to call SIX times to now get a completely different answer about how I will get my refund (over a month after the non-flight). I've also filed a complaint through their website with no response.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew with my two children, ages 5 and 9 on a pre-booked flight with assigned seats from Newark to LAX. The flight was cancelled but automatically re-scheduled for same time the next day. We were given 3 seat assignments, all of us separated from one another. The ticketing agent told me there was nothing she could do because it was overbooked but to tell the gate agents. I did and they refused to seat us together on the 6 hour cross-country flight, but were happy to add stand-by passengers to the flight and offered to try to seat them all together! I then asked the flight attendants who nastily also refused. I pleaded with them that my kids were too young, esp, my 5 year old, to sit without me, and with strangers for this long flight. They rudely told me tough luck. I was panicking then, but I knew it was best to stay calm and polite. When I asked again, the agent told me that I might prefer de-planing and explaining my problem to TSA. It was exasperating. The Alaska Newark crew - all of them at the gate and in the plane - were nasty, taking advantage of post-911 TSA threats for any reason. I wrote a letter when we returned and got a canned response--with $75 vouchers which are absolutely useless - you can't use them for regularly priced tickets. If I wanted to buy a $2000 one hour flight which is priced at $49 by Southwest, the vouchers work. Never used these and when I told them about this, they offered me a few thousand miles instead - also worthless but also so I am forced to fly with them again. Not only were my complaints not adequately addressed, they get me to spend more money with them. I wouldn't take it--I would rather they lose my business for life. How do you separate a mother and both of her two young children on a 6 hour flight, and also threaten to de-plane us all because I was distressed? They threatened me because they could.

"Not Verified |  Unfortunately, the plane that we were taking had some mechanical problems when it landed from the flight right before us. Not knowing the extent of the repair, they had us all board and then realized that it was going to take longer than they anticipated to fix. So, the captain came out and told us what the problem was and then told us that we could get off of the plane and wait in the boarding areas. Of course, no one was happy about the delay -- BUT, Alaska did everything they could to make our 4.5 hour delay bearable. They gave us meal vouchers to use in the airport ($12 each) and issued each passenger a $100 discount code to be used in the next year. While we waited not knowing what to expect, the airlines and the gate personnel were amazing about keeping us updated. They even took our cell numbers in case we wanted to venture away from the gate areas to personally call with updates. We got regular texts from the airlines - and constant smiles and apologies from the staff. One of the gate personnel, Tiffany, went over and above to make us all feel cared about. She even took our 11 month old grandson and played with him for a little bit to help keep him occupied (at this point, he was already bored with us).

"✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to Chicago. After checking in online and receiving an electronic boarding pass we tried to board the plane to be told we had to go back to the desk. We had booked premium seats and already paid the upgrade. At the desk we were told ""NO I DONT HAVE THAT HERE"" and the rude woman on the desk would not listen or look at the booking receipt we had. We were told there was never a 17C seat in premium (despite my boarding pass and email confirmation). We were not the only ones, some people from First Class and others from Premium had the same issue and we were all put in economy and handed a number to call ""take it up with them"". Appalling customer service. We all boarded the flight and sat on the tarmac for over two and a half hours. There were no pilots to fly the plane. Why they let us board and sit there in the heat is unacceptable. The crew informed us at the end the ground staff knew there was a plane change and kept all the crew in the dark so they would keep us all on the plane. Just confirms they are a terrible company to work for with a real lack of respect for their employees. This morning after complaining I was offered initially a $75 credit each towards a flight for the 2 bookings. I had to tell them I wanted the money for the upgrade back as I did not receive that service.

And since my beloved daughter keeps buying me the ticket to come visit her, I keep having to fly with them. But oh my goodness have I had it!

And this time, today, when she tried to call and cancel twenty minutes after buying the new ticket, they told her she had to pay again to cancel her brand new purchase! This is the only airline I've hear charges you to cancel a purchase within 24 hours. The attitude she got not only from the customer service agent, but from the manager who was nothing but a waste of time. She told my daughter she ""had to listen to the recording of her request to make sure what had happened, and then she would call her back"". Really? Please! Do yourself a favor and avoid this airline. The so called lower fares are not worth dealing with a bunch of ""agents"" that have zero intention in offering any customer service. The only thing in their minds is how can they get more money out of you. This is the second time in 3 months they do this to my daughter.

"✅ Trip Verified |  We had such an unnecessarily difficult trip today (actually spanning 2 days). On our way to the East coast from Kauai, our aircraft was diverted to Honolulu because they needed to refuel. This caused us to be over an hour late to land in Seattle.

✅ Trip Verified | Sacramento to Edmonton via Portland/Seattle. I will never be flying with this airline again. My party of four got to Portland only to find out that our connecting flight to Seattle was cancelled meaning we wouldn’t be able to make it back to Edmonton. After waiting for almost an hour we got to talk to a representative. They were nice but not at all helpful because our party had to be split up and half of us had to stay overnight in Vancouver and half flew took a different flight. I triple check to ensure that my sister who I was traveling with and my luggage ended up in Vancouver with us and I was assured that it would be there for us to pick up. We flew Air Canada which was delayed by 2 hours. Once we landed we went to baggage claim only to find out that our luggage isn’t there. Once we start asking around we find out that Alaska Airlines never handed our bags over and so we have no idea where our bags are.

Since I HAD to be in Vegas that night I agreed. When I finally got to the airport and my gate I saw there was another flight #1940 departing at 7:35pm. The agent never even mentioned this airline to me. And to add to my woes, the 9:30pm flight was delayed by almost 45 minutes. we finally landed at 11:40pm, and by the time I got to my hotel it was 1:00am. I had an important meeting at 9am. They changed the flight departure time to be 30 minutes early with just an hour to go. They not only asked me to pay up for their mistakes, but hid info from me about a flight earlier than the 9:30pm one. This not only shows their dishonesty, but also utter disregard for their customers' time. It was my wedding anniversary and I wasted 4 hours away from my husband basically haggling with Alaska to just do their job. Their 9:30 pm flight was delayed as well, for what reason, nobody knows. Even my return flight from Vegas to SFO is delayed by about 30 minutes, and I am here at the airport since 6pm, as per their demand of being 2 hours early. Not just this, my flight from SFO to Seattle last year was delayed 4 times. Even now, when I am just checking their other flights (in case they show their true colors and delay my flight even further) everything is delayed! How can an airline be so incompetent?!  They asked me to pay up for their mismanagement, which I find ridiculous. This was my last time flying Alaska.

"Not Verified |  Arrived at gate 1 hour early. Told by gate agent flight delayed due to delayed inbound flight. Given exact time to return to gate for boarding. Sat down directly opposite to gate, well within range for announcement. Returned to gate at appointed time to board. Doors already closed and no staff at the gate. Sign overhead said ""doors closing soon for boarding"" but no one was there to serve customers. Found agent at another gate, quickly explained that gate sign indicated that it might still be possible to board. He then took another call while the opportunity to board closed. Went to customer service. Not so much as ""gee I'm sorry"". Asked if a flight to Sacramento might be available since I could easily drive from there. Customer Service had great difficulty understanding. Said no Alaska flight to Sacramento. Walked down the concourse and immediately found a Sacramento flight ready to board (would been available for rebooking during the timeframe I was talking to Customer Service). Gate agent said he had a seat available but I'd have to go to Customer Service to rebook. Ran back to same Customer Service agent who actually asked me what I was doing there and claimed there were no flights to Sacramento even as her airline was boarding a flight a couple of gates away. Said go back to the gate. I said they told me to come here. She strolled over to the gate. By the time she strolled back it was too late. I've been an Alaska MVP at various levels for more than 35 years. I've sat at many a gate and heard many a gate announcement and occasionally been paged. Hearing my city or name has never failed to get my attention.

"Not Verified |  Recently took a trip back home for Thanksgiving, at this point I wish I had stayed home. My flight from Juneau was supposed to leave at 2:24. I arrived at the airport at around noon, with the realization that I would be in the airport for 3 hours (after 2 delays). At the time I was totally fine with this (traveled enough to know). Approximately two hours into my wait I received another notice that the flight would be delayed an additional two hours. I decided to go home and planned to arrive an hour before boarding time. After arriving at the airport I was told that the plane (which was suppose to have arrived in Seattle at 12:00) had not left the airport and another plane was being sent our way. Seven hours after my flight was suppose to depart, we had left the runway. Upon arriving in Seattle we made a phone call to Alaska Airlines about our connecting flight, their response “We don’t know”. After 2 hours of being in Seattle we had received a call from Alaska stating that our connecting flight would not leave until 7:55 (24 hours after our original leave time). At this time we booked a hotel room and an additional car rental (on top of the one we canceled). We arrived at our final destination without any additional complications, but lost an entire day with family and friends for the holidays. The experience did not end here. Upon my journey back home, we had a delay of approximately 1 hour. When we boarded the plane we were told that we had an additional 1 hour and 30 minutes to departure and could leave the plane if we wanted. I am currently sitting in Denver waiting to hear about when we would be boarding, so far all we know is that we will be arriving in Seattle at 10:30 but when we ask when we will be departing we get “I don’t know”. I have been thoroughly disgusted with my travel with Alaska Airlines and will be hesitant to book another flight through them. Side note: we did receive a nice email from an executive stating we would receive $150.00 for our troubles which doesn’t come close to the $1000 we have spent on car rentals, the loss of vacation time from work and time spent with family.

"✅ Trip Verified | I guess it must be the Virgin merger/sale but this airline is terrible now. Their planes look like they were bought from Virgin at a bargain sale. They haven't taken the time to remove all the old Virgin decorations, so it's a terrible mix of Alaska's and Virgin and it just feels odd. The seats are poorly arranged which gave a lot of legroom, too much because you couldn't even reach the seat in front of you for the pockets, and there was no room to store your bag under that seat. Seriously, the only way I can explain how bad the plane was is to say it looked like it was bought at a garage sale. Don't expect help from the gate agents, it seems the only requirement for their jobs is apathy. I arrived 10 minutes before the posted time on the gate and they wouldn't let me on the plane. The plane was sitting at the gate as they typed up a new ticket for tomorrow. Other airlines have let me go, or walked me down. I walked away from the Alaska gate staring at the plane sitting at the gate but I couldn't board it. Unfortunately, even airlines like Alaska are realizing that customer service is just not needed for airlines. They know some people will be forced to fly them, or will just forget how bad their service is. I would avoid Alaska for the foreseeable future.

"Not Verified |  Seattle to Ketchikan. Easily printed our boarding passes at self-serve kiosk. When we arrived at the gate and inquired about early boarding (husband has a hurt knee, was using a cane), not only were we granted early boarding, but they also changed our seats to ones much closer to the front of the plane so husband didn't have to hobble so far. That was nice. Then we were seated on the plane, parked on the tarmac, for over 3 hours but they were great about it! The entire (Sea-Tac) airport was fogged in, no flights were allowed to take off or land. About 30 minutes after the initial delay, we were told by the Captain that we had the option to get off the plane while we were waiting for the fog to lift - but don't go too far, cause when it's our turn, we're taking off. The Captain updated us about every half hour as to our status, weather, etc. During each of the updates, we were reminded of the option to get off the plane if we wanted. Amazingly, not one person got off. I was pretty comfortable, and I think it was just the comfort of knowing I could get off the plane if I wanted to, kept me calm and comfortable. Then after maybe an hour, the stewardesses got on the P.A. and initiated a guessing game, with various snacks as prizes, until the prizes ran out. That was cool, an amusing distraction. Then, finally the fog lifted, and instead of being anywhere from number 25-40 in line for take-off, we were #4, as a result of nobody getting off the plane, we were ready to roll. A few ten minutes later, we were in the air. So, fast check-in, helpful gate assistance, pilot with options, and fun, creative stewardesses made a huge difference from what could have been a long, sitting on the tarmac for 3 hours, claustrophobic, trapped on a plane into a delay that was broken up with announcements, games, snacks, etc. and ended with a smooth flight, and a great landing - in fog at our destination!

"✅ Trip Verified |  We boarded at N Gate 12A. One of the people I was sitting near found out that there would not be a boarding ramp that connected to the building for us to get on the plane. The agent at the desk told us that we had to walk down 2 flights of stairs, across the tarmac, and then up a winding ramp to get into the plane. Several of us agreed we couldn't do that, mainly the two flights of steps. I ordered a wheel chair to take me down the elevator to the lower level, across the tarmac, and up the ramp into the plane. Some of the rest of them just walked along with me and went down the elevator, too. N gate 12A had hardly any places for people to sit and wait, and people were sitting on the floor all around that gate. That plane was either a 737-800 or -900, and I think they should have been able to have it come in to a gate where there was a boarding ramp. The young man right ahead of me was in a wheel chair, also. He decided to walk up the ramp after we got out to the tarmac. He had feet that turned outwards, and he had a terrible time walking up that ramp into the plane, especially because it was a winding ramp. He was right ahead of me, and I watched him walking. What an experience. It looked like Gate N12A used to be N12, but the airlines had chopped it up into 3 pieces so they could have 12A, 12B, AND 12C. Hard to believe such a fancy airport has nowhere for people to sit while they wait 2 hours for a light. The old lady who was already sitting in a wheelchair was one of the few who had a seat.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Salt Lake City to San Diego. Alaska never fails to disappoint! Only took the flight because it was free (used miles to buy). My wife is in a wheelchair, and the only thing Alaska cares about is trying to get an extra couple of $$ out of you. I have a Frequent Flyer number, so I get checked bags, yet they still want to charge. I offer for them to check my carry on, but they want to charge me until I get to the gate then they ask for people to volunteer to check their bags. (frustrating) I have learned not to use their Wheel chairs, because they leave you in the handicap seat at the gate and take the wheelchair. Which makes it hard to get your wife to the bathroom when you have a 2 hour wait. They won't upgrade people with medical conditions, first responders, teachers etc. to roomier seats even if they go empty. WHY??? All they care about is money not people.

"✅ Trip Verified | Boston to Seattle. Overall an above average experience, but a bit to be desired on the competitive trans-continental route. The gate area used at Boston Logan for Alaska is quite lacking, with only one little area with especially overpriced food and old-looking carpeting. Onboard, legroom is beautiful, with plenty of room as one who is 5'10 or about 177 cm. Seat width on 737s is typically an issue, but I actually found it to be quite doable on this long haul. Now, what I alluded to regarding competition is JetBlue, who provides free WiFi and seatback entertainment, with plentiful snacks and drinks. For this route, JetBlue and Alaska were the exact same price, and I decided to try Alaska to try something new. Alaska skimped on the drinks, charges a whopping $45 for wifi (except iMessage, WhatsApp, and Facebook messenger, which can be used free of charge), and offers on-device entertainment through an app, or a tablet for $10. I purchased the fruit and cheese platter for $8.50, which was fine except for the slightly browned apples. I ended up being double charged and am still awaiting my callback regarding my dispute, after four days now. The plane was brand new, just two years old, and the gate staff and flight attendants were particularly kind and helpful. Another huge plus is an outlet and USB port which is on the seatback, actually, making very easy access, as opposed to between the seats near the floor. Alaska Airlines is definitely above average, but certainly there are better options, such as JetBlue, on the market.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Los Angeles,November 2018,no,   boston to seattle overall an above average experience but a bit to be desired on the competitive transcontinental route the gate area used at boston logan for alaska is quite lacking with only one little area with especially overpriced food and oldlooking carpeting onboard legroom is beautiful with plenty of room as one who is 510 or about 177 cm seat width on 737s is typically an issue but i actually found it to be quite doable on this long haul now what i alluded to regarding competition is jetblue who provides free wifi and seatback entertainment with plentiful snacks and drinks for this route jetblue and alaska were the exact same price and i decided to try alaska to try something new alaska skimped on the drinks charges a whopping 45 for wifi except imessage whatsapp and facebook messenger which can be used free of charge and offers ondevice entertainment through an app or a tablet for 10 i purchased the fruit and cheese platter for 850 which was fine except for the slightly browned apples i ended up being double charged and am still awaiting my callback regarding my dispute after four days now the plane was brand new just two years old and the gate staff and flight attendants were particularly kind and helpful another huge plus is an outlet and usb port which is on the seatback actually making very easy access as opposed to between the seats near the floor alaska airlines is definitely above average but certainly there are better options such as jetblue on the market,boston seattle overall average experience bit desired competitive transcontinental route gate area used boston logan alaska quite lacking one little area especially overpriced food oldlooking carpeting onboard legroom beautiful plenty room one 510 177 cm seat width 737s typically issue actually found quite doable long haul alluded regarding competition jetblue provides free wifi seatback entertainment plentiful snacks drinks route jetblue alaska exact price decided try alaska try something new alaska skimped drinks charges whopping 45 wifi except imessage whatsapp facebook messenger used free charge offers ondevice entertainment app tablet 10 purchased fruit cheese platter 850 fine except slightly browned apples ended double charged still awaiting callback regarding dispute four days plane brand new two years old gate staff flight attendants particularly kind helpful another huge plus outlet usb port seatback actually making easy access opposed seats near floor alaska airlines definitely average certainly better options jetblue market,NEU

"Not Verified |  Newark to Los Angeles. I will never use Alaska Airlines again due to the poor customer service I just received. I’m disputing a claim because I was charged erroneously for more than 1 bag for a flight I took in October where the agents at the desk took separate payments for myself and my friend who traveled together. There's allegedly no record of her paying for her own bag (i find that hard to believe) and they charged me twice. The customer service agent at Alaska Air didn’t want to help me unless I could produce a receipt, which my friend doesn’t have because this is now over a month later and she probably threw it out. So I’m being penalized for their oversight, and my bank is siding with the airline. This is the worst customer service on an airline I’ve ever had. Not to mention you get absolutely nothing when you fly anymore, the planes are getting smaller and flights keep increasing. All I’m asking is to be refunded for 1 bag - you’d think I was asking for a kidney donation. It makes no sense, if I was paying for her bag, why was I not charged on the way back?

There was a mom sitting in front of us with two children, one of whom wasn’t behaving well. He had some kind of device playing a game that was really annoying for the rest of us and the stewardes politely but firmly said he couldn’t remain with the sound on but she would get some headphones. The plane wasn’t completely full and once we had taken off, the stewardess gave a few passengers the option to switch into other seats to make this flight a little more comfortable. She did it in a well managed way. The stewardess then brought the child in front who was still having problems something to amuse him and a treat. He still wasn’t behaving well for his stressed mother so the stewardess took him for a walk around the plane to give the mom a bit of a break.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Ft Lauderdale to Los Angeles. This was the most terrible flight experience ever because of one flight attendant. She was rude, unprofessional, unreasonable and ill-mannered. Her attitude doesn't belong to any job with customer service involved. It started with me not feeling well at the take off, so I had to first use my ""little red bag"" for that purpose & then two more bags of people traveling next to me. As soon as seat belts lights were off, I got up & proceeded to the bathroom to wash myself off. I kindly asked the male attendant, who was there, for extra bags, since I was feeling ashamed to ask people at front or rear rows for their bags. The attendant apologized to me but admitted they were completely out of bags! I went back and had to ask complete strangers in the back of my seat row to borrow their bags. I was then throwing up for another 30 minutes or so in fear that I will use all other bags and run completely out of it. My neighbor then brought me some napkins, so I was very grateful. I also used all water I had left in my bottle. I got up again & went to the bathroom. When I came out the attendant's cart with drinks was literally at my 19th row but they were still servicing people ahead of my row, so if they would move just one row back I would take my seat, but the flight attendant refused when I asked her to allow me to sit. I had to go back to the bathroom area to wait while I was so dehydrated that I could't even stand without leaning up against the wall. The FA passed by me few times taking more drinks (small wine bottles) with her. One time I stopped her asking for a cup of water. She said she can't stop the service because it wasn't her fault that I missed my time in my row. I pointed at the bottle of water standing near her working station, but she said its was her partner's bottle that he was using. It was obvious that the bottle was unopened and full. I explained her that I was feeling really sick, but she pretended not to hear me, and went back to serve others.

"Not Verified |  Seattle to Reno. The flight itself was smooth. The steward was very rude. They wouldn't serve soda, even though the cart was full. They said the flight was too short to serve drinks, but served water, juice and you could buy alcohol. That makes zero sense that the flight was too short to serve drinks, (soda only), but they served drinks. That being said, my flight home, which was the same distance, served drinks including soda. Still scratching my head on that one. Anyhow, we were shortly going to start the descend into Seattle so I started to get up to use the bathroom and the FA very rudely told me to sit back down, I could not use the bathroom. It was another 10 minutes from the time he told me I couldn't use the bathroom until the fasten seat belt sign came on. Then he came by and got in my face and again, rudely told me to put my seat back up. I didn't even realize my seat was back because the person behind me kept pulling my seat and apparently it reclined it and I didn't notice it. He could have politely asked me. I was never rude to him although maybe I should have been. Even the people around me kept saying ""what is this guys problem"". I have never been on a flight with such horrible behavior from a steward. My flight home was great until I retrieved my luggage. My zippers were ripped off my bag and someone had gone through my bag. I thought if TSA searches your bag, they have to put a note in your bag that they have done so. I have had this happen before; there was no note that TSA searched my bag so if this is protocol, then Alaska should be keeping an eye on their employees. I feel very violated.

Why should that mean no welcome drink? Ground congestion at YVR delayed us and we only just made the connection at Seattle. Ground congestion there was extreme, nearly an hour from push back to take-off. This meant that we did not get lunch until nearly 4 pm. Catering when it finally arrived was good, though.

"✅ Trip Verified | After vacationing in Alaska we used Alaska Airlines - needless to say we won't make that mistake again. We landed in Seattle and had about a 2 hour layover. We grabbed a bite to eat and headed for our gate only to find no one there. We asked if there had been a gate change and found out that yes it was changed. The agent was about as personable as a badger. We had to jump on the train and get to another concourse and fortunately made it there in time. The ticket agent at this gate, who had her hair piled on her head that looked like a birds nest was about as pleasant as the previous agent. We finally got onboard and sat there for the next two hours. The plane had sustained a bird strike which required a one hour maintenance review. The next hour was spent waiting for them to fuel the plane which was not taking fuel. After a two hour delay we finally took off. Upon our arrival in Dallas we went to collect our luggage. It used to be brown, clean and very nice. That is no longer the case. Least I mention that I am also missing a shoe which leads me to believe that baggage handlers went thru my luggage. Needless to say I was furious and was told that no one was available to take our claim at that hour of night. We incurred further expenses because we had to book a hotel as we had been up since 2 am, it was then 9 pm and we still had to make a 3 hour drive to get home. I also had to pay my dog sitter an additional day. I have filed a complaint within Alaska Airlines policy of making said complaint within a 24 hour window. Thus far all I have gotten back from them is an email acknowledging the complaint and that it will take them approximately 30 days to respond. Their customer service is non-existent!

"✅ Trip Verified |  Seattle to Portland. Terrible experience with our carry-on luggages. My husband and I were required to check our carry-ons because we were informed right before entering the plane, that the plane was too small for luggages. We never received luggage tags and were told to go ahead and board, that we could pick up our bags immediately after the flight. This flight was delayed 45 minutes, we arrived in Portland only about 10 minutes before our connecting flight to Detroit was leaving. When we attempted to pick up our carry-on bags from the people unloading on the tarmac, we were told to head to our connecting flight and that our luggages were also going to Detroit. We asked the gentleman unloading to allow us to take our luggages with us, since they were on the cart in front of us but not tagged, however he refused and told us he would be sending them to Detroit and was bringing them down in 4 minutes. Even though it was clear he had no way of knowing which luggages were ours and needed to go to DTW. At the gate before boarding the plane, we again explained the situation to one of the gentleman in charge of the boarding process and that our luggages had been taken from us, however, we never received any luggage tags. He asked us to describe the bags and assured us we would have them once we landed at DTW. Once we landed at DTW we headed to baggage claims, however, our bags never arrived. We proceeded to the Alaskan bag check-in counter, since the Alaska baggage service office was closed and there was no sign indicating when it would open. There was a gentleman who finally assisted us by having us write down our information. However, he said since we did not have official luggage tags no further inquiry could be made. When we insisted we receive some sort of confirmation or claim report to verify record of this incident he assured us his supervisor would meet us at the baggage claim service center to assist us further. We returned to ground level and waited in front of the door for over 20 minutes before returning upstairs to see if she would still be coming to meet us. We spoke with the same gentleman who helped us earlier he assured us she was on her way. After returning downstairs and waiting for another 15 minutes she came and took an official claim. The entire ordeal lasted for almost 2 hours. Due to the incident our transportation to home was delayed and my husband was unable to make it to work. When I arrived home I spent the majority of my day on hold with Alaska Air. I was on hold for over 2 hours, the operator said I would receive a call back in over 3 hours! When I finally received a call back I was placed on hold again for another 20 minutes, the person I spoke with said our luggages should be leaving Portland only that night and which would arrive at 4 am the next day. When I asked them to confirm they were out luggages, they could not. It was over 24 hours and we did not receive any updates on the status of our lost luggage from DTW service center. Furthermore, I repeatedly tried calling Alaska Air baggage service office with which we made a claim at (DTW) and was unable to speak with a representative, no one picked up.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Why there is not zero star? This airline should be zero. I came to Dallas from Maui. When I came to Dallas TX, the flight delayed 3 hours. Many passengers had to transfer at Seattle. The people had stood in line for 1.5 hours with big stress.  My flight was delayed and cancel in yesterday. They booked today’s flight with first class. The flight delayed again and again in the morning. I should wait for 7 hours in the airport to take the flight with first class. I thought it can be delayed and cancel again and again.

"Not Verified |  Denver to San Francisco. I had a very poor experience last week with Alaska Airline. I booked a one way flight from Denver to SFO (FL 1867) scheduled to depart at 516 PM. On arrival to DIA, told new departure time was 6 PM. They had to wait for ""paperwork"". Finally boarded after an hour then sat in plane for over another hour because they said their tug had a dead battery. At this point they had to get another pilot or co-pilot as they had already worked more then permitted hours. Finally we were underway over 2 hours late and we were told gate agents would meet us with information on connecting flights. We landed then had to wait to taxi to a gate and officially arrived 2 hrs and 31 minutes late. There was no gate agent there on arrival and I missed my connecting flight to Palm Springs. I had to look for a departing Alaska flight to find an agent. I had checked online and there was a United flight leaving at 1030 PM that I could have made had there been an agent to meet us. I could have been given a hotel voucher but decided to take a 6 AM flight to LAX so i ended up at airport all night. Then Alaska told me they would Uber me to Palm Springs at their expense as there were no flights to PSP that day. My Uber driver didn't find me so I had to wait in line again for 40 minutes and Alaska did send me to Palm springs by Super Shuttle.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Denver to San Francisco. I decided to try them out because I've heard they were good. Never again. Several minutes before the boarding time, there was no plane at the gate. The gate agents were nonchalantly chatting and poking around on their terminals. No announcements or explanations. Passengers wondering aloud what is going on. When the boarding time ""came and went ""with still no plane at the gate, only then did their app update with what I would soon discover was a random new boarding time. After another update, the plane arrived and we all boarded a roasting plane. The captain said there was no APU available at that gate to boost the AC. We were an hour late by now. Nothing was ever mentioned about the lateness so I assume it's normal for them to be late. Then, the plane had a mechanical issue at startup. They apparently have no pull at Denver International, because it took 20 mins for anyone to even arrive at the plane to examine the problem. The prognosis was not good, so they let everyone deplane again. They asked people to ""stay in the area"" although for much of the time there was no Alaska Airlines staff at the gate counter - just a bunch of passengers wondering what was going on. After another 30 mins the flight was canceled. My impression was that this airline, at least in Denver, is amateurish. They offered compensation by a computer-generated ""heartfelt"" email, but it was just a credit toward a future flight.

"❌ Not Verified |  Having been a dyed in the wool Virgin fan, I was eager to see how Alaska measured up. They didn't. I flew back from Philly on a Sunday evening (7:45 scheduled departure). The flight didn't take off until 10 p.m. I wasn't notified via text until 6:30 that it was delayed (same thing happened on the flight from SFO to Philly). Had I been notified a bit earlier, I could have stayed and had dinner with my son before going to the airport. How is it passengers aren't notified sooner than an hour before the flight that there are system wide delays due to air traffic control issues in Philly that had been an issue for hours on both flights? Worse yet, I flew First Class and was looking forward to seeing how it matched up with Virgin. Sadly, no comparison at least no in this flight. While the flight attendant was good, they seemed totally unprepared for passengers. He had to go to the back to get mixers each time. Dinner was a mess.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Fort Lauderdale to San Francisco. I have never flown with Alaska Airlines before. I had heard good things and was looking forward to my direct flight home from a week long vacation. Unfortunately however, I had a terrible experience. Before we took off, the flight was delayed several times. The lack of information from Alaska staff was the worst I have experienced. During the initial two and a half hour delay the only announcement that had been made said ""The flight will be delayed by 80 minutes due to weather, which is good news compared to what I was hearing."" Alaska staff seemed surprised when people came up to the desk with frustration. After boarding three hours late and being requested to buckle seat belts, we were told we'd be off the ground asap, max 30 minutes. The flight took off 80 minutes later with absolutely no further announcement. Once up in the air, my seat did not go back. My screen brightness buttons did not work. My headphone jack did not work. There was no USB charger. And the wifi did not connect for the entire six hour flight. If all this wasn't bad enough, Alaska flight staff then decided to offer double shot free alcohol to a clearly unstable gentleman sitting in the seat closest to the exit row door. This decision put the safety of all passengers on board at risk. After 3-4 large drinks, the gentleman proceeded to shout loudly on at least 10 separate occasions, and continued to act erratically. After another gentleman on the exit row requested to be moved, he was left alone in the exit row to potentially open the emergency door in his inebriated state, or perform action in an emergency situation! My wife was seated directly in front of this now drunk, unstable man and genuinely feared for her safety. Finally the Pilot was summoned to threaten an emergency landing and FBI action.

"✅ Trip Verified |  LAX to San Francisco. After dealing with parking and the shuttle chaos of the LAX, my family arrived as they called for boarding to the counter. We were refused our paid in full passes, and told we couldn't board the flight. We could see the gate from the counter, and there wasn't a line for TSA.

"✅ Trip Verified | Austin-San Diego-Austin, First Class on Alaska Airlines / Skywest E-175. Easy check-in with 3 bags to check. Enjoyed the Admirals Club at AUS, which still has a great staff, even though food offering are lagging Delta's or United's Clubs. Quick boarding as this jet only holds about 70 passengers. For a regional jet, seats are plenty wide and comfortable with average at best legroom. Power port at every seat is nice. Pre departure beverage and an on time departure. Right after take off, First class was treated to Virgin America's signature smoothies, which I enjoy and I thought this level of service, along with a printed menu indicated a fine meal was forth coming. I'm a fan and love airline food and never complain, however the meal, if you can call it that was the most appalling breakfast I have ever seen, on a plane or the ground. Half dollar size, dry and cold scrambled eggs and a salmon cake of similar size. Thats it. Beverages served in plastic cups. No mugs for coffee either. Just abysmal. The return flight, easy check-in despite the poor condition old San Diego's terminal 1. No lounges, poor food options, as we thought of eating before getting on the flight, due to the service on the way to San Diego. Fast boarding, no pre departure beverage this time, no problem, once airborne, printed menus again, followed by warm nuts in a ramekin, then a large, nicely presented dinner of chicken with wine sauce. Rice and whole grains were on the side. Bread warm bread with butter and a small dessert of apple crumb cake. Over all very satisfy and tasty.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Originally scheduled to fly from Dallas Love Field Airport directly to LaGuardia. There was inclement weather forecasted for NY later that day, so I paid a $25 change fee to fly out on a different flight that departed 2 hours earlier around 10:30 am. However, the storm hit NY earlier and my new flight was delayed over 4 hours and eventually canceled after sitting on the tarmac for an hour. Once we were notified of the cancellation, I called Alaska Airline’s customer service to rebook my flight. There were no direct flights available and there were no flights available to get me home that day. I was offered two options on different airlines: either fly to Seattle that night and take a red-eye to JFK or fly to Los Angeles and take a red-eye to JFK. Neither option would get me to LaGuardia, which was where my car was parked or get me home in time for an important event I had scheduled for Thursday morning. Because of this, the customer service representative offered me a $75 travel credit, reimbursement for the flight change fee that I paid for my canceled flight, and reimbursement for my travel from JFK to my car at LaGuardia. Once I returned home, I called Alaska Airline’s customer service to work out the reimbursements; however, I was told the airline does not provide reimbursements for flights canceled due to weather.

Now today, on my return flight, my boyfriend and I booked using ""companion fare."" He's been an Alaska cardholder forever, and he purchased his ticket full price while giving me the discounted companion rate.

We paid for his ticket, never asked for or expected a refund since it was a last minute emergency, and I paid my companion fare price in full. I'm not unreasonable - I understand that the ""rule"" states we must be flying together. But that ""rule"" was never made clear to us in the booking process, and we couldn't have seen this emergency coming. My real issue is with the way I was treated - the flight attendants loudly told me to ""exit the plane immediately,"" forcing me to inconvenience everyone in my row so that I could get my bags down and haul them through the isle once more. I got all the way to the door (walking past 24 rows of people) when they informed me that the boarding door had closed, and they'd ""be forced to allow me to fly - but never again in the future would this be allowed.""

"✅ Trip Verified | Flight from Hawaii to Seattle OK, good sevice from crew. Connecting flight from Seattle to Victoria, a short 30 min. flight, total disaster. Flight cancelled due to ""weather"" (so airline assumed no liability and provided no assistance, even for overnight stay in Seattle), when the weather at both the origin airport (SEA) and the destination airport (YYJ) was clear (ceiling at Seattle at least 7,000 feet, visibility at YYJ posted online at that time of day as > 12 miles with one passenger hearing a report from his family at destination that they could see stars in the sky, winds low (< 10mph), no precipitation. Of all of the bogus claims I have ever been subjected to, this one has got to be one of the worst. A Delta flight flew the same route just 20 minutes earlier without delay. The cancellation was announced almost an hour before departure - without even waiting to see whether, in fact, weather remained (or ever was!) an issue. No other cancellations observed on the screens at SEA that night and no other cancellations shown online at YYJ. Apparently, there had been fog at YYJ the two previous nights, so my only guess here is ""pre-emptive cancellation"" (a cancellation because someone thought there *might* be fog again but didn't bother to either check or wait to verify). The next day, there was a wait list for the first flight out. My wife and I had gotten the last 2 tickets on that flight. After Alaska offered $0 for the overnight delay and their phone number for discounted hotel rooms [""at passenger's full expense but we'll at least help you get a discount""] turned out to be worthless (phone number had automated, ""sorry, no rooms available"" message), they NOW offered $400 each for people willing to give up their seats and fly 2-3 hours later. Normally, I'd say ""sure"" if this was a non-work day (I tend to jump at anything above $150/hour) But my wife's wisdom on this question was worth listening too: ""$400 in cash? sure. $400 in airline coupons good on Alaska?

"✅ Verified Review |  Vancouver to Seattle. Outbound from YVR to SEA was a good flight, until touchdown at Sea-tac. The flight departed and arrived on time, except it gated late. Reason being was another aircraft was getting deiced at our gate. The flight gated late by about 20 minutes - airport's problem. Otherwise, pretty solid flight; good attitude from cabin crew; cabin lights shut off in the duration of the flight so people could sleep; no food or drinks served due to the shortness of in-air time; clean interior. Inbound from SEA to YVR in the same afternoon was cancelled due to snow. (This is an Alaska flight operated by Horizon Air.) Went to the counter and was told to go to customer service - which had about a 2 hour line. They cancelled a lot of flights. Wanting to come home I booked a one-way with AC. After my return to YVR, I received a text from AS that I got rebooked on an 11pm flight to YVR, which I no longer need. I called Alaska, lined up and got a call back after an hour.

"✅ Verified Review |  Orange County to San Francisco. My first and last time flying Alaska Airlines. Our flight was supposed to leave at 8:47am, then delayed twice because of San Francisco grounding international flights (yet we were domestic trip, but Alaska Airlines parks in the international terminals at SFO). When delayed for a 3rd time, the attendant at the booth stated the next flight will not leave until 2:50pm. We confirmed with attendant to make sure there will be no chance for an earlier flight and he stated ""No, there will be no earlier flight then 2:50pm and to check on Alaska Airline app or website for updates."" It was 10:45am, so we decided to leave airport to grab lunch and come back for 2:50pm flight (we were not the only passengers that left airport). While at lunch my boyfriend checked website and app (which did not work) on his phone, so I checked my phone and it stated 11:30am flight boarding. We decided to call 800# customer service to get clarification. Customer Service Rep stated they show 11:30am flight, we explained our situation and all they said was ""You should have not left the airport"". I called the airport directly to confirm and make sure Alaska Airlines knew what they were talking about, at this point we have lost all faith on anything Alaska Airlines were telling us. The airport called to the gate for us and confirmed they are boarding and will taking off at 12pm. We called back to Alaska Airlines and explained again our situation to another customer service rep. Alaska Airlines rep scheduled us to be on the next flight to SFO at 4:30pm. We asked if they could do anything for us (move us up 1st class, comp drink tickets, etc). No, as delay was not Alaska Airlines fault it was SFO, yet they did not even listen that it was their attendant who gave us false time. We arrive back at the airport by 3:30pm and plane was delayed 2 more times to 5:50pm because crew was stuck in SFO and flying down.

"✅ Verified Review |  Seattle to Los Angeles. I had a flight that was originally scheduled to depart at 740pm. I had a 1 hour and 21 minute layover and was supposed depart on Virgin America from LA to Boston. The flight out of Seattle was delayed until 8.45pm. I got out of the plane at 1124pm and missed the 1126 flight to Boston. The crew on the flight said there would be a representative available for those connecting with Virgin. There was no representative around for questions. Virgin America told me I would need to find an Alaska representative. I looked all over the terminal and finally found 2 at Gate 69A. They initially tried to help, but since it was almost 12 by then they were eager to leave for the night. They told me to go to Customer Service next door and someone would help me. I waited 10 minutes and no one showed up and the other workers left for the night. I had to resort to calling customer service. They informed me that I was rebooked for a 7.50am flight with Virgin America the next morning. I was never made aware of that or given options. They also would not give me a hotel claiming it was due to air traffic control and they were not responsible. So I got stuck at the airport for the night. The customer service was terrible. Honestly, I fly a lot. I had really liked flying with Alaska previously and was going to fly more with them. I even got their credit card.

"✅ Verified Review |  New York to Lihue via Seattle. I booked a trip to Hawaii on Alaska almost 1 year before the flight date. This week, Alaska decided to change all of their flights, turning what would have been an 11 hour trip to New york into a 20+ hour trip with an overnight layover. I am flying with a 9 year old. When I called two days ago the agent had offered to fix my trip by routing us from Ogg->LAX->JFK. I called back today (2 days later) to take them up on that offer, and the agent said she would be unable to do that, and that I'd have to buy a whole new ticket. This is ridiculous on multiple levels. First, I paid $3000 for the voucher I used, which was donated by an Alaska executive at a Parkinson's charity auction. I am happy to track down and document all the details of that. Second, It is the airline schedule change that is causing this issue. Third, Alaska Airlines offered me this remedy two days ago, which was not ideal, and are now retracting that offer. Frankly, I'm speechless. This is the worst customer service experience I've had in a long time. Probably ever. And this is just the return flight. For the outgoing flight, they've change the schedule so that my connection now departs before I arrive.

"✅ Verified Review |  We flew from Saint Louis to Anchorage with Alaska Airlines. One of our bags did not make it on the plane in Seattle. When we arrived to Anchorage, we realized it did not arrive. The luggage service told us they did not put the suitcase on in Seattle because the ""plane was too heavy"". They offered a $25 discount on future travel! They could not tell us when our luggage would arrive, despite at least 10 flights a day from Seattle to Anchorage. Furthermore, they could not tell us when we would receive a bag.

"✅ Verified Review |  Detroit to Seattle. Phenomenal service, excellent food. This is my first time flying Alaska, and I chose them because they're partners with Virgin, it was my best flight in a quite a while. This plane was older and the interior was showing wear, so I was a little concerned about what to expect - worry not, you're in for a top notch experience with Alaska Airlines. Service was super friendly and attentive, meals were designed by Seattle chef Tom Douglas (I skipped the entree & dessert, so I can't comment on that) but the salad was very nice, dinner smelled wonderful (pesto), dessert was gorgeous, and the beverages never stopped flowing. I've read reviews that Alaska's first class chairs are uncomfortable due to pitch, I didn't find this to be the case - I found them very comfy, but this was only a 4-5 hour flight. The only slight negative was I had planned to work in-flight and the barely there internet connection made that impossible - they use GoGo and it runs $24 for an in flight pass. I'm not sure if the wifi problems were a GoGo issue, a hardware issue, or due to some other factor. I didn't mind though, it was nice to take a break and enjoy some on board entertainment.

"✅ Verified Review |  A direct return flight to Seattle from Boston. Both ways were on time, which is generally regarded as mission impossible in the Boston Logan airport - no idea how they manage to pull it. The return flight landed half an hour early which was very much appreciated, considering that it was almost midnight. Alaska guarantees that the bags are delivered to the carousel 20 minutes from the moment the disembarkation starts, both times it was faster than that. Drinks were served 3 times during the 5 and half hour flight. The selection of meals for purchase was generally so so, but no demerit points for that since it's expected of all airlines. They did give a free cookie. Ample space between seats. The wifi was sluggish at times, but the entertainment package was fine. The crew were efficient and polite. But it's the service that made me write the review making sure the airline gets a deserved praise. After the outbound flight, our bag was nowhere to be found. We filed a report while a very patient and nice customer service lady told us what may be happening. She also said that the bag may arrive while we are filing the report as it may have been misdirected elsewhere in the airport. This is exactly what happened. Her apologetic and helpful attitude was already compensating for the inconvenience. However, we were given $50 discount off the next flight. On the flight back, something started dripping on me from above.

I can't even post a review on alaskalistens because the form doesn't recognize my itinerary. I booked thru Alaska Airlines and they put me on Virgin America for the SFO to LAX leg. When I got to SFO they couldn't book my luggage to Mexico. The counter agent observed or booking was stupid. We told him Alaska booked it this way. First leg ended in LAX, point to point. So our luggage could book thru. After three levels of supervisor and 45 minutes the ticket agent figured a way to get the luggage to Mexico but advised us to check in Mexico to avoid the issue returning. No agent in Mexico would take responsibility for the issue. As a consequence when we got to LAX on the return we had to shelp our bags from terminal 6 (Alaska) to terminal (3) Virgin to recheck them in. Took so long we missed our flight to San Francisco. We are long time Alaska users with a credit card and a mileage plan. Very disappointed.

"❎ Unverified |  My wife and I recently flew to Kona, HI from Anchorage, AK. Prior to boarding we took in the Alaska Boardroom and enjoyed our time there. We flew in the Premium Economy section and had no complaints. The food was fine as was the service. The aircraft was clean and the flight was smooth. Upon landing in Kona we went to pick up our bags but as luck would have it, ours and 40 other folks did not have any! As it turned out, these bags were left in Anchorage. Something to do with weight, headwinds or whatever. This was not something that we expected and we were not pleased but Alaska did try to meet our needs somewhat. We were offered either a coupon for $100 off a future ticket or 4 thousand miles on our Mileage Plan. I took the miles as did my wife. Our luggage was delivered the next afternoon. There were some folks who were quite upset over this and I felt bad for the employees having to try to meet their needs. Our stay in Kona was not good due to sickness for the entire 11 days but I must say it was a beautiful place, we plan to return and stay where we were this time. Kona is not a bad place to be sick I must admit! Our return trip went through Seattle and again we were in P/E section. Everything was fine, again a great crew, clean plane and wonderful service.

I tried to do something awesome for my mom since it was her birthday and her first time to Hawaii so I upgraded our seats to ""premium"".

If I have the ""first class curtain"" hanging in my lap and in my face every time someone walks through it then it's not a premium seat. If I have to go from row 7 all the way to the back of the plane to the lavatory, then the seat isn't premium. If it says I get chocolates, almonds & cranberries & what I get is 1 square of dark chocolate, a snack size bag of blue almonds (approximately $0.50) and a snack size bag of ocean spray cranberries (approximately $0.50) then it's not premium. If it says to power up with a power outlet at every seat but every seat on the whole plane has one including the regular fare seats then it's not premium. When it say complimentary drinks but the attendant comes by once the whole flight that's not premium. When it says I can recline but the seats only go back as far as the normal seats then it's not premium.

Then the flight attendant prosseded to give my 5 year old pop every time he would ask but my wife and I were not sitting in same row and could not see. My wife got to sit beside 2 people that had to use belt extensions - it was fun for her. When we got to Seattle they had seats for us - one for me but the kids and wife they oversold. They know when you book flights how old people are so the idea of splitting up a mother or father and a 5 year old is ridiculous.

"✅ Verified Review | Seattle to Los Angeles. Alaska Airlines has gotten better over the years but still has a ways to go. Many of their flights are still late and they generally do an awful job of updating the electronic screens at the gates. The screen will say a flight is boarding in 5 minutes when there isn't even a plane at the gate. It's also comical how Alaska charges most of their passengers to check a bag but then offers to do it for free as nearly every flight has issues with overhead bin space. So if you're flying Alaska check in online and choose zero bags to check. A screen or two later Alaska will usually offer to let you check your carry-on for free. And even if they don't, they almost certainly will offer to do so at the gate. Why not offer a free checked bag to everyone if you're going to offer that anyway? It's not fair to those who paid to check their bags. On the plus side their newest planes (the ""next gen"" 737-800 and -900) have more generous legroom and power at your seat. On the downside you have to use your own device for inflight entertainment. Alaska could learn something from Virgin American (which they now own). They do offer free (for now) streaming shows over WiFi but it's cumbersome, buggy, and you have to click past several screens trying to sell you GoGo inflight WiFi. While they offer a decent selection of paid food and beverages they have only a single food and beverage cart for the entire plane and a 737-900 is a long plane. So it takes something like 45 minutes for the service to work its way from the front to the back. But my biggest complaint about Alaska is they have many flights that are chronically late, yet they refuse to change the scheduled times. Even the flight crews have no explanation why they don't change the scheduled times. Southwest flies many of the same routes and puts Alaska to shame with their on-time record on those flights. And if anything goes wrong, like bad weather (we recently had snow in Seattle, for example) look out as Alaska turns into total chaos - especially at SeaTac. Wait times exceed one hour for calling them, lines stretch way down the hall from their customer service counters, their website falls on its face from the load, etc. And if you do stand in line for hours trying to rebook your cancelled, or infinitely delayed, flight, you're usually offered nothing useful and a joke of a customer care package. Basically they just seem not to care as they already have your money. Alaska charges at least $125 to make any changes to most flights and it's often horrifically expensive if you have to make a last minute change. This is in stark contrast to Southwest that charges no penalties for changes. Alaska's boarding is annoying with several ""tiers"" of preboarding which often amounts to at least a third of the plane with many of those people still blocking the aisles once they start general boarding. Again, Southwest is a far more pleasant and efficient experience. But airlines like United are even worse in this regard. Overall, for west coast travel I often have my pick of Southwest, Virgin America, Alaska, Delta, and United. And I try to book flights in that order of priority. Alaska is my third choice after Southwest and Virgin.",Business,Economy Class,San Jose to Vancouver via Seattle,February 2017,no,   seattle to los angeles alaska airlines has gotten better over the

I flew with a certified service animal from Dallas to Fairbanks via Seattle. On the plane from Dallas to Seattle my service animal (a large dog) were asked to deboard because they had sold the seat next to me. Both the gate agent and the reservations agent I spoke with encouraged me to buy an extra seat on the Seattle to Fairbanks flight to ensure there was room and stated a refund would be issued with no problems if there were open seats left on the flight. Upon calling for my refund because there were open seats, the customer care agent was extremely rude, said they would refund it only this once and never do that again. She proceeded to hang up on me and not confirm the refund. That topped off with the ""don't bother me"" attitude of half my flight attendants has ended my loyal use of Alaska Airlines.

"✅ Verified Review |  Spokane to Portland. Alaska Airlines tends to provide pretty consistent service, but I have become more dissatisfied by their service. My wife and I had to commute from Spokane to Portland to get to work. The night before there was some snow but by the time we were going to leave it was clear. So like a typical there needs to be clearing of the runways, de-icing of the planes, etc., but it appeared that not only did they not take care of this prior to us boarding, but as we were boarding they still told us that we were leaving on time. Even after sitting on the plane 25 minutes after we were supposed to leave, we were finally told we were going to have to pull out on the side of the runway and wait another 40 minutes to de-ice and wait for the plane's oil to warm up. I understand that all these things need to happen and sometimes there's issues, it's just the poor preparation and the lack of communication that makes this service dissatisfying.

It was 7:40 at the time, my boarding pass said 8:10, she said that gate 65B was just right next to her. I went to the restroom and came back to gate 64A thinking gate 64B was right next to her based on the information given to me, to find out gate 64B was actually down the hall and around the corner. By the time I got to gate 64B it was 7:59. My friend told the lady working at gate 64B that I was in the restroom and I would be there in just a minute but they closed the flight anyway. I could see the plane right outside the door, about 40-50 feet away. It was a small plane with the step ladder still attached to it. They did not accommodate me in any way whatsoever.

I felt like I was launched back to the 80s and 90s when it seemed airlines really cared about their passengers. I can't say enough about the quality of the crew aboard each airplane. Remember the old days when you were told several times during the flight what was going on? Last night we experience turbulence on the flight and the captain announced to us more than once that it was going to be intermittent throughout the flight and why, jet stream winds that we were going through and not to worry as it would not get worse than what we were experiencing. He was very reassuring and kind. Also, when do you have the cockpit crew stand with the flight attendants as you are leaving the cabin to greet passengers? Extremely impressed! The absolute only negative is that the planes are a little old and the seats are not that comfortable, but each seat has an electrical plug and there is wifi on the airplane. I will definitely fly Alaska again. Also, we went into the Alaska Club in Seattle and were greeted warmly as we asked a few questions about becoming club member. The lades were wonderful and couldn't have been more helpful.

"Just returned early this morning from a return to the Greatland with my wife from Nashville. Our original plan was to get back up here and leave in two days to Kona however life intervened and we now have to depart tomorrow back to Nashville due to the passing of her father. I was on the phone for over an hour dealing with an agent from Boise who was fantastic! She rebooked our Kona trip to March and got my wife, son and I out tomorrow evening to Seattle where we meet our daughter and then all of us to Nashville. The service this company provides is outstanding. Our flight out of Nashville eventually was fine as we were stuck on I-65 for three hours due to a huge wreck. We cut it a bit close but got out ok. The pilot reported that headwinds were going to be getting us in to SEA about 15-20 minutes late.

"✅ Verified Review | Kahului to Victoria via Seattle with Alaska Airlines. The first problem I encountered was that the online check in did not work, and when I called Alaska Airlines, they said they are having a glitch in their system and I should go to the counter in the airport to complete my check-in. When I went to the counter and explained the problem, the agent insisted that I need an ETA visa to enter Canada. I knew this was not correct, but she insisted I cannot received my boarding pass and I may need to cancel my flight. I had to purchase internet as the terminal does not have free access to WiFi in order to prove to her that I don’t need an ETA.

"San Francisco to Seattle. I just had the worst week of flying Alaska Airlines ever. They cancelled my flight to the Bay area from Seattle on Tuesday because of the weather. In fact, it was cold but dry with no ice. They rebooked me on a flight for that evening, even though there were seats available on earlier flights. Coming home today, my flight was also cancelled. I was due to land at noon but there was a chance of snow in the evening, so I guess that was what they were worried about? Again, they automatically rebooked me but for 6:48 AM the next day (when there actually would be snow on the ground)! I spent 2.5 hours on the phone (from 11pm to 1:30am) trying to get through to customer service because they wouldn't let me rebook on line. I got up at 5amand finally made it through to them. By dressing and leaving within 10 minutes I was able to make the only flight available that day but I had to go to an airport further away than my original one.

"Anchorage to Nashville via Seattle. Once again I found myself flying with Alaska Airlines best. When I went to check in at the counter at Anchorage I was informed that my flight to Nashville was cancelled out of SeaTac. I had heard about some weather related problems which could possibly affect Alaska's flight operations there. I told the employee it was no issue as I could spent the night at the wonderful USO there. The flight was great - gracious crew, on time, clean plane etc. It was a redeye so we arrived at about 4:45 AM. I looked around and found no snow anywhere. I asked at customer service about this issue and was told that about 30 of their flight were affected. I asked why were other airlines apparently not affected and she had no idea. I was offered a coupon to stay locally but said no thanks and spent the next 26 hours at the USO, watching tv, talking with the folks and the great staff. The flight out to Nashville was fine with another wonderful crew. I had the BBQ sandwich and a beer. All in all this was good. I did note quite a few others on the flight were stuck in SEA overnight like I was. Other than holding folks up for 24 hours in SEA it appeared to be taken in stride. I will say that more than a few of us found the weather excuse to be somewhat strange though.

The outbound flight was operated by American Airlines. I selected the seats so that family would be together. On July 15th and again August 11th I received an Email from Alaska Airlines that stated: ""We need to let you know about a change in your itinerary. The details of the change are below, but rest assured you are booked on the closest available option to your original itinerary. Your new reservation is confirmed and you do not need to reconfirm."" Then the email read: ""Here is your updated flight information"", which included the new flight #, the new flight time (less than 10 minutes time difference) and it listed our original seating arrangements. The day before the flight I wanted to be among the first to check in and print our boarding passes. To my surprise not only am I required to select seats, their were no seating options that keeps our family together without an additional fee. This change was not mention in the Email. In fact the email list in detail the original seating selections under ""updated flight information"".

American Airlines said to contact the company I booked the flight with. I booked this trip with Alaska Airlines and therefore I expected them to fix this problem. It's very important to us that our family is seated together on our flight. Less than 24 hours before the trip we cant get a refund and we can't book a new trip without outrageous cost, so we flew without all of us being seated together.

"Anchorage to Nashville via Seattle. Another great trip with Alaska Airlines. The flight down to SEA was on their Combi 400 the cargo / passenger plane. Nice flight with a great seatmate. Arrival was early as it was a redeye. Spent some quality time at the Boardroom as I usually do - no issues there. I was bumped up to First on the leg to BNA. The crew and service was great, no problems noted. I arrived on time and thanked the crewmembers for the great service. The return to ANC was a bit unusual for me this time as I flew to SEA spent the night and then departed the next morning. The flight began about 30 minutes late due to storm issues in Seattle which caused some backup in the system but it was no problem on my end. The flight was quite bumpy in parts but no problems. The service was great as was the food. Arriving in SEA I slepped over to the fine USO located there and spent the evening talking with the outstanding staff and various Soldiers, Sailors, Marines and Airmen who were enjoying the hospitality as I was. I got to my 8:30 AM flight and had the pleasure of sitting next to a fine Alaska attendant who was heading back to the Greatland. As I was departing the aircraft in ANC she noticed my wallet which had departed my pocket somehow and got it back to me. My only issue was at baggage claim. I watched the clock countdown and my bag got there in 21 minutes. As this was not the 20 minutes they strive for I grabbed my bag and went to get my 2500 miles added to my account. The young lady working there said they had made it as they did not go by the time which was at the claim area they go by another clock apparently which us passengers are not aware of. The lady in front of me was not pleased and neither was I. I told her as a Gold member this was the first time I had run into this issue and it sort of sounded like false advertising.

"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to Yakima. Alaska Airlines is awful. I've primarily flown with them for the past 25 years and they've been going downhill. They don't allow passengers on board during the boarding time, close doors early at airports, charge exorbitant fees for luggage (food, liquor, etc). They tell people to go to the customer service desk, which isn't even open, don't give options when they won't allow you on a flight that they've randomly decided you can't board because they've closed the doors early, and offer you a 50$ refund when you need to rent a car to dive over 4 hours because of it. They don't offer hotel stays, free luggage, or anything. This has gone from being the best airline, to being the worst airline, over the last 25 years. They have a ""20 minute"" baggage guarantee, which always takes longer and they never honor. They charge 100$ for a 20 min flight because they're the only airline that flies out of my small town.

"Los Angeles to Puerto Vallarta. I'm going to say Alaska Airlines 1st class is not worth the money for a number of reasons. Here's my observations from Seat 4D. No immediate service. No drinks/snacks as people are boarding. A usual perk of 1st. Personal entertainment devices aren't always available. (Even when they say you have your own). There is no difference in extra leg room between 1st and economy plus. Just 2 seats a row instead of 3, which is nice, but not for the price difference. Service onboard is not first class quality when compared to Delta, Virgin, Air New Zealand (to name a few). Not even close. Food, drinks, services just not that special. Alaska sells off vacant 1st class seats at the last moment if they're available for $50. This is painful. Great for the person who gets a $1000 seat for $50 - not good when you pay a premium for peace and quiet. But, it explains why they don't care about good service in 1st. Alaska needs to step it up.

"AS 3380, Portland - San Jose, operated by Skywest. Check in at PDX was extremely smooth and efficient, so we had an hour to spare before boarding. Boarding was out of the cramped concourse A and began 10 minutes late with no explanation. Once aboard, the E175 was in good condition and was extremely spacious, even more so than the 737 on the outbound flight, although the overhead bins were small. A weight balance issue resulted in several passengers in the last few rows having to move forward, this took a while as FA's had to recruit volunteers and people were stubborn. Fortunately, we still managed to push back within 15 minutes of scheduled departure and were airborne after a short taxi. Cabin crew were nice, but they could have managed the timing of the short flight better. They spent the first half of the flight chatting in the galley. A small snack with the beverage was a nice touch, but it didn't start until halfway through the flight. Literally right after they finished the beverage service, a flight attendant came through with a trash bag when most people were not even finished, so most had to sit with trash on their traytables while the FA's resumed chatting in the galley. They had more than enough time to get the service done as the FA's on the outbound leg easily served an aircraft twice the size and we still had 20 minutes after the service during cruise. Finally, during final approach, they realized we needed them to collect the rubbish and did so. We landed in San Jose 20 minutes ahead of schedule, and they made sure to brag about Alaska's on-time performance flightstats award. Overall, AS will get you from Point A to B reliably with decent crew and good value, but they shouldn't sell themselves as a major legacy airline when they are really just a decent budget airline. While AS is certainly not bad, I usually try to book with Jetblue or Virgin America due to their combination of a low fare with great service.

"San Jose - Portland, AS 405. Check in at SJC was a bit chaotic as there was little signage or explanation of the procedure for those who had checked in online. This created a mass of confused people looking for the bag drop. Once past security, the gate agent proceeded to yell all of the boarding groups instead of just using the PA. This was a bit bizarre since she used it for a couple of other announcements. Although old, the B737-400 was in decent condition for its age. Only issue in that respect was that my armrest was loose. Seat pitch was reasonable for someone who is 6'0"", especially considering the short duration of flight. We departed on time, but the aircraft PA volume was so low that passengers could barely hear announcements. Cabin crew also failed to enforce important safety regulations such as windowshades being drawn up for takeoff and landing. (So that people can easily see out in case of an evacuation). However, they did manage the short flight time extremely well regarding the beverage service. They all were extremely polite and genuine. This genuine caring among its cabin crews is one of Alaska's major strengths. We landed on time in PDX with the 20-minute baggage guarentee being met. Overall a nice short hop.

"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Anchorage to Las Vegas. This was an overnight flight of 4 and a half hour, plus 2 hours of time zone adjustment so the flight departed at 11.30pm arrived at 5.30am. It was on time. Alaskan Airlines has a good reputation and service attitude was good. Non-alcoholic drinks were served free several times during the flight, while others were available at reasonable cost. The checked bag cost USD25. It would be a good flight were it not due to the aircraft. It must be an early 737 and there was no TV, the seat back doesn't recline, making the 4-hr flight uncomfortable, though seat pitch was good.

"Portland to Dallas Fort Worth with Alaska Airlines. We flew paid first class in seats 2A and 2C. Prior to departure we were in the PDX Alaska Board Room (paid membership). The place was dirty. Boarding was slow, mainly because there seems to have been only one gate agent working a full flight. As a result, we pushed back about 15 minutes late. The gate agent acted as though we were a bother to her - a real attitude issue. The four FA's working the flight were more interested in chatting with each other and constantly checking their iPhones, than interacting with passengers. This was particularly true later in the flight when the FA's gathered in the forward galley for a chat-fest. Our seating area was filthy, with coffee stains and food crumbs on the tray tables and the area between the seats The IFE on Alaska is woefully inadequate; in 1st, you are offered a DigEPlayer (like a small tablet) preloaded with content. Your other choice is to stream content on your own device, but to do so, you must pay for it. This is inferior to the AVOD on American and Delta that is complimentary in 1st. First class catering (lunch) was a joke - a warm turkey sandwich. It was the one and only option. The worst part of the trip was the seating on the Boeing 737-900. First off, the 737-800/900 seat pitch on Alaska is less than on Delta and far less than on American. Moreover, the first class seats would not recline. The seats were miserably uncomfortable and inferior to the seats used by American and Delta.

"I flew my favorite airline once again to Las Vegas. My flight to SEA was up in First Class as I was bumped due to my Gold status. The flight departed on time at 5am which was not too fun. The customer care was great as usual though - everyone was a bit on the tired side upon our arrival. I had a couple of hour wait until my next flight, grabbed some coffee and watched the hustle bustle of those around me trying to catch their flights off to different parts of the globe. My flight to LAS departed on time with a great crew. A few bumps here and there but all in all no problems. I met my daughter there who had taken a early flight out of SEA and off we went. While in Vegas we managed to get out and see a show and it was very nice. I would also mention that we used Uber and Lyft while there. I had never used such service before and was very impressed - I also enjoyed saving money too, about 50% of the cab fare! On time out of LAS and early into SEA, and I went to the new Boardroom in the North terminal and had some refreshments, (the soup was great) chatted with some fine Alaskans waiting to catch flights and thanked the folks who work there for their customer service.

"Flew Alaska Airlines down to Las Vegas via Seattle to celebrate my daughters 21st birthday. I met her at SeaTac after flying in from Anchorage.

"This was my eleventh and final trip this year. As a retired guy I have plenty of time on my hands, so I check out various airline vacation deals. I noticed a great deal to Las Vegas with Alaska Vacations. Departing on Monday, we flew to Portland on a daylight flight. The crew, plane and service was just fine all the way around. Landing at PDX we noticed how much rain the area had been receiving - what a mess. The airport was fine. We were there about an hour before we departed to the land of Lost Wages. The pilot informed us that the climb out may be a bit on the bumpy side and we had to stay at a lower altitude the entire way due to upper level turbulence. It was not bad at all. On our return, our departure flight was to be a bit on the bumpy side but we had been warned of this. Just prior to departing the pilot came out and talked to us about his 26 years of experience with Alaska and how much he, his co-pilot and crew appreciated our flying with them. I have seen this a couple of other times and I was impressed. The flight to SEA was great. Our departing Seattle was expected to be rough and we were informed that we would climb out at a lower altitude for some distance due to expected rough air, not bad though.

"Our flight #121 from Seattle to Anchorage was not only approx an hour and a half late but we also shared half the aircraft with a load of freight?

"Returned last night from Seattle with Alaska Airlines after visiting my daughter there. The flights were fine in both directions. I had hoped to get bumped up to First, however, that did not happen. I was pleased with seat 8F down and 9F back. There is only so much the flight crews can do on redeye flights but I will say the flight crew on the way back to the Greatland was impressive as one of the passengers two rows up from me experienced some type of medical issue. Three of the four attendants worked with him and all went well upon our arrival. We were ontime and had snow waiting for us - how nice. My bag was about one minute late so I received my 2500 mile voucher. I informed some of the other passengers who were waiting with me and they too got miles. I read the review of the unhappy customer who flew to Mexico recently, I have to say that the issue of paying for anything in First Class is incorrect based on my experience.

"The seats were uncomfortable, barely reclined and featured an ""innovative"" design to provide 3"" of leg room. I'm tall and I would expect 1st class to provide extra leg room. Not on Alaska Airlines. My knees were crushed for a good part of the flight. Food, other than soft drinks all other beverages cost. Nothing was complimentary. The meal was a TexMex Salad that was mostly a pile of lettuce with cheese on top. A prepackaged cookie was thrown in. Coach had options better than First class. Upon asking for some fruit from coach I was told ""we'll see"" and it was going to cost me extra. Coffee was never offered and upon asking I was told maybe they had some in coach but they were out. Little to no complimentary inflight entertainment. That was going to cost too. As soon as we were over Mexican airspace the whole system went dead. No wifi. Not even when flying in American airspace. If it was offered, as apparently it was on some flights, it was going to cost. After meal service, I couldn't get a even a small bag of pretzels. No effort was made to make the flight more comfortable or to provide any alternative food. The crew was friendly enough but seemed inexperienced in providing any first class service. Oddly the flight began with an announcement from the pilot (male) on how attractive the all female flight crew was. I felt as if I had stepped back 50 years. Though minor, it wasn't appropriate or professional. My expectations for first class aren't all that high. A comfortable seat, plenty of leg room, complimentary beverages (inc wine), somewhat of a more substantial meal than you would receive in coach and at the very least a flight crew that tried to make your flight as pleasant as possible. Alaska Airlines provided non of these. No blanket or pillow, nothing to read - having to beg for coffee? And above all else I conveyed this info to Alaska Corporate/Customer Care. Nothing from them with even a hint they might want to retain a customer. If you are going to spend the extra money to arrive refreshed via flying first class, heed my advice, find another airline.

"Another wonderful trip on Alaska. The flight from ANC to SEA was great, the crew was excellent, flight was on time, all in all no complaints whatsoever. I was looking forward to the next flight, SEA to Raleigh as this was the first time Alaska flew there. They had a nice going away ceremony at the gate with all sorts of breakfast items, short speeches and a ribbon cutting as well. The aircraft we flew on was the special Russell Williams plane which I think is the 900 model of the 737. It was quite the arrival in RDU! Although it was raining upon our arrival, there were numerous television crews both outside and inside to catch shots of the plane, crew and passengers. The RDU folks that greeted us, (about 75 or so) lined up, gave each of us a welcome to Raleigh bag of goodies plus clapped and cheered for us. I was amazed at the welcome - Southern Hospitality at its best! The only downside was that our luggage did not get to the passengers within the 20 minute guarantee. We each received the 2500 mile ticket to apply to our Mileage Plan - it's all good. The flight there was great by the way - 4 hours and 26 minutes with very little to gripe about.

"When I rushed into the Boston airport wearing my ten-month-old son in a baby carrier and balancing a 55 pound anxious dog in an oversized crate on an unthinkably tiny luggage carrier (oh, Logan!) while my three-year-old clung to my thigh things were looking bleak. We were running late and I wanted to check in the dog while my husband dealt with the rest of the luggage, the rental, and a looming police officer. I was frazzled, but the Alaska Air staff spotted me right away and from then on our travel experience went smoothly. He really made sure that all the documents are checked as quick as possible and helped me take the dog crate through inspection. No one gave me any trouble with the dog, and we received a ticked assuring us that she was on the plane with us in the cargo. We found her safe and sound at our destination. All the while the staff member was entertaining and patient with my curious and slightly anxious daughter and assured me that he will take care that my husband gets on the plane in time as he was late returning the rental car, which he did. Everyone else working with Alaska Air was very courteous and attentive as well. Since we booked our seats late, we were not assigned to the same row, and with two small children this six hour flight could have turned very ugly if we were kept apart. The flight attendants took care of this issue right away and adjusted our seating so that we were in the same row (also thanks to two gracious gentlemen who agreed to switch their seats for us). The flight was long but comfortable, there was enough leg room even in the economy seats with snacks, drinks, and entertainment tablets making the long flight with tired kids tolerable. By the way the food was hot and delicious. Another nice touch came when we requested an entertainment tablet which was ten dollars per piece. The flight attendant noticed that my husband gave it to our daughter right away, so she gave him another one at no extra charge. No one harassed us when our kids were getting loud and impatient (which happened couple of times and ended very quickly, they are such good kids), and no one mentioned anything to me as I was nursing my little boy for most of the flight.

"There have been numerous incidents with Alaska Airlines while my daughter has lived in Mammoth Lakes over the past 5 years. Today, Sept 15, 2015 my daughter, who had made her reservation weeks ago to fly down and go on vacation to a central coast beach town, got a text at 1 pm today notifying her that her flight had been cancelled. The next flight is tomorrow evening which would have her arriving at 7ish and we are due to be at our vacation destination tomorrow. If she took the offer for tomorrow we would be losing one nights hotel stay nonrefundable as there is a 48 hour deadline to cancel. She called Alaska Airlines to get her refund as now she has to drive down to LA by herself in order to make our plan work. She asked why the flight was cancelled, already knowing what they would say. Alaska Airlines go to phrase for cancelling flights is ""mechanical problems"" when the flight isn't full enough. Sure enough that is what she was told. I'm thinking really, there are 3 hours before the flight leaves LAX for Mammoth and there isn't a working plane available to be brought in? Well, of course there is nothing a passenger can do or say to change the ""I don't really care about you"" attitude that exists in this situation.

This Alaskan Airlines trip has been the worst travel experience by far.

"Usually I am more than pleased with my trips on Alaska Airlines. I am a Gold member and will be again for this next year. The trip from Atlanta to Seattle was delayed due to a mechanical issue, starboard engine. This was fixed and we were about two hours late departing ATL.

Flew with family SJC-Honolulu then returned to SJC via Seattle. Economy Class. All planes were 737's of some variety. The seats were comfortable with adjustable headrests but legroom was terrible. I'm short so this was only a problem when I (or someone else) wanted to use the restroom as the person on the aisle seat had no choice but to get out of his seat to accommodate us. The cheese platter is an excellent meal available on all flights. Availability of hot meals was inconsistent and confusing (available one direction but not the other on flights before 9 am or after etc.). Flight attendants were friendly and attentive. However on our trip from HNL-SEA they disappeared 3 hours into the 5.5 hour flight and we were getting thirsty. Had to go ask for water. Hint: Alaska boards very early (45 min) and will depart early if they can.

I had never flown Alaska before this past 2014-15 Christmas/New Year season. My fiancé had relocated for work to Portland OR from Massachusetts. We had two cats to move and decided it would be best for them to fly with me in the cabin for the holiday. The operator who booked the flights with my fiancé was so helpful and made sure we had all the information we needed to get the cats ready. When I got to Logan Airport in Boston I was allowed to board early with the cat carriers. When one of my cats started getting antsy in her carrier and I had the carrier in my lap the stewardesses asked if the kitties needed anything. There was no fuss or problems traveling with the cats. Check in was smooth and easy on both going and coming. The Alaska Airlines staff is genuinely friendly and pleasant which is such a change from the canned fake concern most airlines staff seem to have. The mileage club is so easy to use and keep track of miles. It is nice to see that customer service is still a virtue in some companies.,,Economy Class,,,no,i had never flown alaska before this past 201415 christmasnew year season my fiancé had relocated for work to portland or from massachusetts we had two cats to move and decided it would be best for them to fly with me in the cabin for the holiday the operator who booked the flights with my fiancé was so helpful and made sure we had all the information we needed to get the cats ready when i got to logan airport in boston i was allowed to board early with the cat carriers when one of my cats started getting antsy in her carrier and i had the carrier in my lap the stewardesses asked if the kitties needed anything there was no fuss or problems traveling with the cats check in was smooth and easy on both going and coming the alaska airlines staff is genuinely friendly and pleasant which is such a change from the canned fake concern most airlines staff seem to have the mileage club is so easy to use and keep track of miles it is nice to see that customer service is still a virtue in some companies,never flown alaska past 201415 christmasnew year season fiancé relocated work portland massachusetts two cats move decided would best fly cabin holiday operator booked flights fiancé helpful made sure information needed get cats ready got logan airport boston allowed board early cat carriers one cats started getting antsy carrier carrier lap stewardesses asked kitties needed anything fuss problems traveling cats check smooth easy going coming alaska airlines staff genuinely friendly pleasant change canned fake concern airlines staff seem mileage club easy use keep track miles nice see customer service still virtue companies,NEU

"SEA to IAH return. First time flying on Alaska. Both legs were on time. Service was friendly. I appreciate the communication from the pilot or first officer with respect to turbulence and what's happening with the flight. Leg room was decent for economy class. Not a big fan of their food and beverage selections. Being a bit of a nervous flyer I generally tend to ask for 3 glasses of red wine when drink service is offered so I can slip slowly and make them last for a 4 hour flight and mellow out. One Flight Attendant took exception to me ordering 3 glasses (apparently fearing I was going to become intoxicated on the flight). In addition the wine service is poured from a bottle into a plastic cafeteria cup. Other airlines simply give you a little bottle which you pour yourself (which I much prefer). So this aspect was about the only thing that I give a thumbs down to. Another thing I like about some other airlines you have your own IFE system display.

Recently traveled for the first time on an Alaska Airlines flight from San Diego-Boston. It was the best domestic flight I have experienced. The 4 cabin crew members were excellent and very customer engaged with passengers needs. The flight wasn't full and they came to me and asked if I wanted a row of seats to myself to relax for the duration of the flight. The service was great 3 rounds of snack and beverage service for the 5-hour flight. The aircraft was a Boeing 737-800 and the legroom was great. A job well done. I look forward to flying onboard in the near future. The only downfall to Alaska Airlines is they charge $10.00 for a video recorder to watch the movies.

Returned last week from a ANC-SEA-ATL and return in First. No complaints with the flights at all. As usual (for me) the service was outstanding the planes clean and the flight crews were very friendly. We were told we would be departing ATL about an hour late due to a crew rest issue. This would cause me to miss my connection to ANC in Seattle. I was rebooked quickly by the ATL folks. I caught my flight with minutes to spare in SEA but of course my bag did not show until the next flight. The Alaska employee at baggage claim was tired and a bit grumpy but I was given a coupon for 2500 miles and that was fine with me. Besides this issue all was great. Looking forward to our next flight to SEA this Thursday evening.,,Economy Class,,,yes,returned last week from a ancseaatl and return in first no complaints with the flights at all as usual for me the service was outstanding the planes clean and the flight crews were very friendly we were told we would be departing atl about an hour late due to a crew rest issue this would cause me to miss my connection to anc in seattle i was rebooked quickly by the atl folks i caught my flight with minutes to spare in sea but of course my bag did not show until the next flight the alaska employee at baggage claim was tired and a bit grumpy but i was given a coupon for 2500 miles and that was fine with me besides this issue all was great looking forward to our next flight to sea this thursday evening,returned last week ancseaatl return first complaints flights usual service outstanding planes clean flight crews friendly told would departing atl hour late due crew rest issue would cause miss connection anc seattle rebooked quickly atl folks caught flight minutes spare sea course bag show next flight alaska employee baggage claim tired bit grumpy given coupon 2500 miles fine besides issue great looking forward next flight sea thursday evening,NEU
We have just arrived back in New Zealand after our Alaskan cruise and would like to commend Alaska Airlines customer service desk for their excellent and sympathetic response to out late arrival due to tardy shuttle service resulting in our late arrival at LAX airport. We were very stressed as were to travel to Seattle the staff member advised that although our flight hadn't quite left it was indeed too late to get on but immediately advised that they had a flight every hour and could get us on the next flight.

Alaska is our airline of choice. MCI-SEA-ANC flights generally good and on time. New Sky interior slimline Recaro seats (a bit uncomfortable). On landing at Anchorage the pilot apparently took a wrong taxiway or misjudged the turn as he braked to a halt (squeal on the brakes hard stop) then used reverse thrusters to turn the plane completely around. ANC-SEA-MCI late flight out of ANC substituted a smaller plane which put us in a non-recline seat. All in all we have been satisfied with Alaska and will continue to use them as these are somewhat minor issues and tend to be found on all airlines.,,Economy Class,,,yes,alaska is our airline of choice mciseaanc flights generally good and on time new sky interior slimline recaro seats a bit uncomfortable on landing at anchorage the pilot apparently took a wrong taxiway or misjudged the turn as he braked to a halt squeal on the brakes hard stop then used reverse thrusters to turn the plane completely around ancseamci late flight out of anc substituted a smaller plane which put us in a nonrecline seat all in all we have been satisfied with alaska and will continue to use them as these are somewhat minor issues and tend to be found on all airlines,alaska airline choice mciseaanc flights generally good time new sky interior slimline recaro seats bit uncomfortable landing anchorage pilot apparently took wrong taxiway misjudged turn braked halt squeal brakes hard stop used reverse thrusters turn plane completely around ancseamci late flight anc substituted smaller plane put us nonrecline seat satisfied alaska continue use somewhat minor issues tend found airlines,NEU

"Recently flew on Alaska Airlines with my 2 longer legs (TUS to SEA and ANC to PDX) in First Class. On these flights (along with the other 2 segments) the flight and flight crew were fine. My complaint is with what defines ""First Class"" to Alaska Airlines. On TUS-SEA our meal consisted of a chicken sandwich and a chocolate mint! No inflight entertainment devices provided. On the ANC-PDX segment (which was 2.45 Alaska time to 7am PDX time). No wake-up breakfast which meant zero food provided at all.

"Flying from Soldotna AK we were fogged in. In only takes a short while for fog to burn off but they delayed the flight twice and then canceled it. I had the option to either have a 12 hour layover in Anchorage or spend the night in Seattle's airport. After waiting 3 hours I was flown to Anchorage. I had 100lbs of frozen fish I worked hard catching. Alaska air refused to help in any way. No mailing my fish home no putting it in a freezer. They refused to put me in a hotel to sleep no options whatsoever. I called them and the woman told me ""We can't pick up the tab for every act of God"" and ""this happens all the time."" Once in Anchorage I tried to switch to the flight where I stay overnight in Seattle because someone I knew had a freezer and I could stay there. Customer service said 1 seat was left while asking her supervisor permission the seat was taken. I took the next flight 4 hours later only to find out the freezer was unavailable so late at night. So I was sent by customer service to get my fish from baggage (it was checked) then come back. I did and asked again to change to the plan to layover 12 hours in Anchorage. I went and waited in line again. I got my fish into the freezer in Anchorage for 28$ not bad but I shouldn't have to pay for that. 3 hours in Soldotna 12 hours in Anchorage a red-eye flight to Seattle then another 3 hour lay-over until my next flight home which is only a 2.5 hour drive.

We flew from Maui to Seattle with a connection in Seattle to Washington D.C. First the plane leaving Maui was delayed for over 3 hours. Alaska Airlines took us off our connecting flight without telling us (Seattle to D.C.) and booked us on a much later flight. Thank goodness I checked before departing from Maui. I was told that they didn't think there would be enough time to make the connection. I asked for them to get me on another flight/airline where I wasn't waiting for my connection for five or more hours. They couldn't do this I was told. I demanded to be put back on the earlier connection and told them I would attempt to make the connection although I had less than 30 minutes to do so. I was told that my seats were already taken by someone else. I informed them that tickets had been given to me already for my seats and they had better get me back on that plane. After some time they did get me back onto the connecting flight from Seattle to D.C. The plane from Maui to Seattle took off several hours late and it did not have very good air conditioning. The plane was hot poor service and I was not impressed at all with Alaska Airlines. I will never fly with them again. The connecting flight from Seattle to D.C. was also very hot on the plane.

Flight was supposed to depart at 1.30pm from Seattle to Long Beach but it didn't. For the first hour the flight was delayed because one of the aircraft crew was late” Then we were told the flight was delayed for another 3 hours. I could not wait any longer. I requested to be put on another available flight to California. I was placed on flight # 464Y Seattle to Los Angeles with departure time at 7.25 pm. I wasted 6 hours of my time and I had to pay an extra fee to rent a car from LAX area and pay with higher rate. I arrived in a hotel at 11.30 pm.

So instead of leaving around 11am we left more like at 4pm. At our first stop in Wrangel some people got on. Then some more. Then a few more. After a while the crew started counting passengers. Then did it again. And again. Then they started asking names as well as counting. Then did that again. And again. And again. As far as I could tell they never found any trouble and never made anyone leave the plane. Then they said we were overweight and had to unload some fuel.

I flew from Seattle to Anchorage on a 737-800 with the new slimline Recaro seats. Each seat had a power outlet with a USB port and the seats were very comfy with an adjustable head rest and more legroom compared to the old seats. I noticed that there was no longer a barrier between first class and coach but maybe they will install it later. I had 30 minutes of free Wi-Fi thanks to a partnership with Allstate. I tested the speed at 2 Mb/sec download and 0.25 Mb/sec upload. I rented an entertainment player for $8 and had time to watch a movie along with a few other clips. The devices are a little slow and touchy but are still functional.

Flew first class from JFK to San Diego flight 769 on April 1. And it did feel like an April Fool return to 1955. No pocket with safety info and sick bag no blankets or pillows provided stewardesses never once went through to collect trash. Food was allergy-unfriendly with bowl of mixed nuts for appetizer and a nut topped parfait for dessert. Worst of all though was the feeling of no safety consciousness. The two stewardesses functioned as - hostesses. Three young men each kept coming up repeatedly to ask a question use the bathroom get a soft drink. The boys would stay in the food prep area for several minutes chatting and then linger in the first class cabin to perform stretching exercises.

"I have been flying Alaska for many years. For the last several years I have been flying first class only and have been very satisfied with the food the service and the extra space. This last trip though made me wonder if I should continue to pay the substantial difference in price to be in first class. It was the space in the new plane. The space between me and the seat in front is closer. I had to struggle to get my bag under the seat in front of me when the passenger in front of me had his seat back. I'm 5'5' and 125 lbs. Also there used to be three big spaces under the 1st class seats for two people. Now there are two with one other smaller space big enough to fit a purse maybe. I don't like to use the overhead but I can change. There still seemed to be plenty of space between me and the passenger next to me. I like the three moveable light fixtures and the ability to direct air flow on the ceiling better. The food is still good and the service good. Although staff service on the majority of my flights has been ""excellent"" I can only honestly rate this last trip as ""fair."" I am grateful to her though for this information. I heard her tell the two passengers in front of me that staff call the new planes ""slaveships"" because there are 44 more seats (!) but no more staff (still 4) to serve passengers. She said something to the effect of ""I feel sorry for the people in back. They get served so late or barely at all."" I'm thinking that on my next trip coming up shortly I will go coach one way just to see if I can still justify paying the difference in price. But thanks to the overheard words of the staff attendant I will sit in the middle or closer to the front in coach so that I will get better service and won't have to wait forever. I will also plan to bring on board some food and a beverage. Overall I really like Alaska although I haven't flown any others for a long time. Maybe I will venture onto another airline just to compare. I never have trouble checking in no lost luggage airport gate staff friendly and professional.

I often fly on Alaska/Horizon flights between Montana and Seattle or Portland. My overall experiences have been very good. Flights even in winter have been on time and counter and plane staff have always been excellent. Value is very good compared with the few other carriers (Delta and United) that we have to choose from here in Montana. Seats on Alaska planes could be more comfortable as they are small and fairly stiff and uncomfortable but most flights are short so it is not a big issue for me.

LAX-YVR-LAX. On the flight to YVR we were greeted with great service at the gate. The aircraft was nice and clean and had a lot of legroom on the B737-400. Even though we were delayed a bit we still had a good flight. The service was great. We had complimentary drinks and the food a cheese plate was delicious and was worth the $7 dollar price. On the flight out to LAX we were delayed from 6am to 11.45am due to maintenance issues. Because of this they rebooked all of the people traveling to Mexico and the first class passengers. They also gave $40 breakfast vouchers. This proves excellent service. Also the first officer took us on a tour of the cockpit which was really nice. Since so many people left this flight onto a flight to Mexico the flight was almost empty. The seats were very comfortable on the Boeing 737-400 and the food and service were great as well especially because they were handing out every order for free due to the delay.

Round trip Seattle to Fort Lauderdale family of 4 for a cruise Nov 8 return 16th.

My main issue is the check in. Flight from SMF to PDX was on the small propeller jet. Those do not have overhead room for normal overhead luggage. But they don't tell you. Hence you are forced to tag bags at the gate and place on cart for checking just like regular checked bags. What if you had something temperature sensitive. It's stupid not to inform customers that the plane does not have normal overhead storage. On the return flight it took half hour to check bags because the airline was understaffed line oppressively long.

I've flown close to 50000 miles this year - all on Alaska Airlines. I've been flying Alaska for 15 plus years. Most of my travel is up and down the west coast with a NY Boston Orlando Chicago trip thrown in on occasion. Overall Alaska has done an amazing job all around. I've had one bag go missing in the last 15 years. It showed up at my door before 8 am the next morning. The food choices are excellent in coach and the few times I've been in First Class it's been wonderful. Their beverage choices are extensive and you can purchase an entertainment system on flights over 2 hours.

I had not flown with Alaska Airlines for a number of years but had a good experience previously. I had a 6 leg trip this past week from LAX to ANC to FAI to Cordova to JNU and to SIT then finally to SEA. Every trip was on time or ahead of schedule. FA were attentive and polite. F&B service was good. I had the food purchase options on 2 flights and was very pleased. Not overly priced and was fresh with good flavor. Only downside was in LAX boarding was chaotic. Gate agent shows up 5 minutes before boarding so many confused passengers. On all flights I noticed the upholstery on the seats were quite worn. A little surprised when most flight were on 737-700 or 800 series aircraft. Anyway all in all a successful trip with Alaska Airlines. Flights on time and my baggage made every flight.

Upgraded to First Class from JNU to ANC for $50 (1.5 hour flight). This was my 1st First Class experience and I was not impressed. Water was offered before take off. The plane was a slightly aged 737-400. At first the seats seem okay but they hardly recline and there is no adjustable headrests. This makes the seats unsuitable for sleeping in. There was also a lot less legroom than I was expecting. I wouldn't recommend putting a bag under the seat in front of you unless it is very small. Since it was morning we were served breakfast. Our drinks were served first along with the standard snack bag that's also served in coach. Then the meals were served. The meal was an egg and bacon French toast sandwich.

Horrible experience transferring from Flight 456 arriving in Los Angeles to Flight 4213 going to San Jose CA. Boarding pass said Skywest but it was actually American Eagle. On arrival at LAX there was no information about either Skywest no indication where it was located and no one who seemed to know. Asked a gate agent who told us it was terminal 8. She did not say it was American Eagle we were looking for. After much walking and asking several people a TSA agent said to go to gate 65 and take shuttle bus to American. Upon reaching American we were told to board another bus which took us to a building near but not even attached to terminal 8.

"June 2013 LAX-MZT-LAX first class. Horrible check in. One first class line which is really 2 lines that mould into one. We stood for 20 minutes as the line grew longer. Whoever designed this lobby should be forced to deal with it on a busy day. When we finally got to the clerk he was surly if not down right rude. He did not speak two words to us. Off to the ""new"" first class lounge. Small cramped dark. Good bar but the small selection of food looked old and un-appealing. I certainly would not pay to get in. Indifferent staff. Boarding was quick and easy. However after it was announced the rear door had been ""armed"" the crew allowed a first class passenger off the plane to purchase an upgraded ticket for his grandson. So we all sat and waited at least ten minutes for him. Inflight the flight attendants on both trips were excellent: attentive friendly helpful. Nice folks. The food? On the way down a limp salad with what I think were chicken strips and a raspberry soda pop for dressing. On the way back inedible pesto chicken. Absolutely unacceptable for the price of a first class ticket. At MZT it took 35 minutes for our baggage to hit the belt. The counter people were slammed trying to check in outgoing passengers so it was impossible to hold Alaska to its 20 minute guarantee.

I am retired and am fortunate enough to fly first class extensively and often on a variety of airlines both in the US and Europe. I recently flew first class with my wife round trip from Las Vegas to Anchorage and plan to never fly Alaska again. Every employee I had contact with was pleasant and courteous the planes were on time but the only benefit in flying first was the additional legroom. The outbound and inbound flights were 2 weeks apart but breakfast both mornings was the same and only thing what they called eggs benedict with turkey ham which was on a piece of dry bread and was tasteless. Lunch was also one choice a chicken salad on a tiny salad plate with out bread cracker or chip desert was one piece of rolled candy. There was no TV on the leg of the flight to Seattle to Anchorage they provided a small hand held screen with a choice of 4-5 movies and short clips. I have never had such cheap and thoughtless meals on any of my previous flights.

Victoria - Seattle - Maui return in First Class. The service was impeccable and breakfast on the outbound flight was very good and spread out over a couple of hours which helped pass the time.

LAX to DCA on May 23rd. Apart from one every other flight attendant was rude and scowled the whole trip.

Alaska Air has a bad reputation because of frequent flight delays. We weren't surprised when our flight was delayed several hours in Kelowna BC on Feb 22nd. We then missed our connections in Seattle and in Portland to Maui Hawaii. After all the delays we were looking forward to finally boarding our flight to Maui and sitting in our first class seats for which we had paid a lot of extra money. What a disappointment! It was an old dirty plane with the most uncomfortable seats we have ever experienced. The seats were old and worn and lacked cushioning. To top it off the backs reclined only about 5 degrees. The inflight entertainment was of such poor quality we couldn't use it - the audio and screen were awful. We are vegetarians and Alaska Air only offers fish and chicken. The good thing about the flight were the flight attendants who were pleasant and cheerful. We arrived in Maui and because of all the delays we were up 24 hours before being able to finally get to bed. So all in all we were not happy customers. Alaska needs to improve their planes and give much more thought to passenger comfort and service.

I recently flew round-trip from Boston to Seattle on Alaska Airlines. I was happy that we: 1) arrived safely 2) arrived on-time. I didn't check a bag so cannot rate their handling of my luggage.

LAX-SJD-LAX Feb 15 First Class. What a disappointing experience. We purchased (not upgraded or miles) first class tickets to Cabo expecting a lot more. The first class seat pitch was awful in rows 2 and 3. Very cramped! Forget it if the person in front of you leans back at all. It also appears that the 3rd (and last row of 1st) has minimal seat recline. The condition of the seats : The leather was very distressed marked up and very worn. When we boarded at Cabo for the return flight to LAX there were crumbs all over the seats and floor. The food (both ways): a chicken sandwich with a single tomato slice some orzo and a piece of chocolate. Not even packets of salt and pepper accompanied the trays. I'd say this product is an embarrassment to this airline.,,,,,,laxsjdlax feb 15 first class what a disappointing experience we purchased not upgraded or miles first class tickets to cabo expecting a lot more the first class seat pitch was awful in rows 2 and 3 very cramped forget it if the person in front of you leans back at all it also appears that the 3rd and last row of 1st has minimal seat recline the condition of the seats  the leather was very distressed marked up and very worn when we boarded at cabo for the return flight to lax there were crumbs all over the seats and floor the food both ways a chicken sandwich with a single tomato slice some orzo and a piece of chocolate not even packets of salt and pepper accompanied the trays id say this product is an embarrassment to this airline,laxsjdlax feb 15 first class disappointing experience purchased upgraded miles first class tickets cabo expecting lot first class seat pitch awful rows 2 3 cramped forget person front leans back also appears 3rd last row 1st minimal seat recline condition seats leather distressed marked worn boarded cabo return flight lax crumbs seats floor food ways chicken sandwich single tomato slice orzo piece chocolate even packets salt pepper accompanied trays id say product embarrassment airline,NEG

The day we were to depart was a bad weather day for the North Eastern part of the country and the aircraft we were to take from Reagan International was delayed due to weather. When we arrived at the airport shortly before the flight I received a call regarding this delay.

I started flying another airline about 2 years ago but today decided to give Alaska another chance. I was sorely disappointed. The ticketing agents greeted me with frowns and a cold mechanical demeanour. The woman managing the line was condescending and seemed irritated with everyone. When I boarded I found my seat 3-A to not fully recline. The amount of leg room wasn't enough to cross my leg at the ankle and the general appearance was worn out and dirty. Once we were in the air the man in front of me reclined and I was no longer able to reach my bag under the seat. Now I would expect this in a coach seat but again they're calling this first class. I was served a lacklustre although well presented breakfast of eggs with tomato and asparagus a potato cake and fresh (ish) fruit. The flight attendant in my cabin was prompt and polite but the announcement about Alaska air credit cards droned on for what seemed like an eternity. Alaska built a reputation with exceptional customer service and a clean well maintained fleet of aircraft.

I fly Alaska a lot - MVP Gold for several consecutive years. I maintain this status mainly through partner airline miles. The main reason I stick with Alaska is that they have direct flights to two of my primary destinations from SEA where other airlines have stops in between. Service on Alaska is wildly variable. One flight will be the best service I can remember and the very next flight will be painful and unpleasant. So - if you are lucky and get a newer aircraft and a good crew you are good to go.

SEA-ANC return in First. On the way up Anchorage was expecting bad weather. The FAs who had already delayed providing any first class service until about 50 minutes into the flight decided more than an hour out of ANC to prepare the cabin for landing. They got on the overhead and informed everyone that the captain had ordered this then promptly ceased service closed the restrooms and plopped down in their jump seats to chat. (This was clearly visible from First.) About a half hour of smooth flying later the pilot got on the intercom and announced that the FAs should begin preparing the cabin for arrival. It was obvious he had no idea the FAs had ceased working 30 minutes earlier. Alaska really needs to do something about its FAs.

Traveled to and from Anchorage from Kansas City in Sep 2012. Amazing to find the Alaska Airlines structures built in several airports to squeeze hold baggage fees from customers - but poorly staffed. Lines were longer when standing in line to check bags where baggage fees had been earlier paid on the web by credit card.

I am not a tall man and my knees were in contact with the seat in front of me for that uncomfortable 3 hour leg.

Had a delay out of Seattle and everyone was made to get off plane travel by train to another terminal to board another plane because of a broken seat. This was obviously known about before we boarded so they should not have put that plane back into service before it was fixed.

Previously I have had mostly positive experiences with Alaska Airlines. However over an hour after boarding the plane we are still sitting at the gate waiting for maintenance and my 16 month old is getting fussy. I ask the FA if she can get us some juice to calm him down and am told no even though she is serving coffee to other passengers. 30 minutes later we are still sitting there and he is seeing everyone else getting drinks but him and starts to cry at which point the FA comes back and tells me to make him be quiet. I fly with my son almost twice a month and have never had a problem. On any other airline they would have tried to help the situation by talking to him or bringing a snack or a pair of wings.

I flew in from round trips OAK to HNL both flights were awful. The money I paid for these two flight's were great and that's the main reason I'm not too hateful towards them. The food was not bad. The staff service was good. The main reason my experience with Alaska Airlines was awful is because the actual aircraft's I flew in were horrible! The seats were incredibly small I was feeling very cramped during the whole flight's it was impossible to sleep on those plane's because the recliner's barely reclined. The leg room was ridiculous it's really hard to get up and go to the lavatory. The lavatory is also a bit small. There was not any complimentary in-flight entertainment expect the crew members offered screens to watch movies shows etc with a 10$ fee. Overall Alaska Airlines is mediocre.

"I bought tickets to fly myself and my 2 young kids (ages 4 and 2) from Salt Lake to Kansas City 2 months in advance. Inexplicably Frontier did not assign us seats together. For each of the 4 legs on this round-trip gate agents did a little shuffling to get us in the same row. But I still had to personally ask other people already on their seats to move.

I've had to fly Alaska almost every Monday morning and Thursday evening for the past 2.5 months from Seattle to Oakland because of a project I was on. Their miles plan is quite generous and I will continue to book with them. Consistently good things about Alaska are their customer service quality (always respectful and accommodating) and on-time flight status (not one single late flight with the exception of a bomb threat which isn't their fault). Consistent areas for improvement with Alaska are their seat comfort (the adjustable headrests are good on the larger planes but the smaller ones lack them and the seat bottoms across are painfully hard across the board - a 1.5 hour flight should not have me in physical pain at the end of it) their wi-fi offerings (there is no way I am paying $10 for slow internet access for 1.5 hours; that's absurd) and their MVP Gold status is so heavily overloaded now that it seems like the majority of the flight is boarded early by them rather than normal flyers (they need to consider revising how these points are earned and applied). Overall I have enjoyed them however and I will continue to use them for my return flights now that my weekly commute has moved to a Seattle-to-Houston trip (there are no nonstop flights going to Houston on Sunday afternoons with Alaska or its partner airlines so I'll have to get there using Continental and come back on Alaska which is fine).,,,,,,ive had to fly alaska almost every monday morning and thursday evening for the past 25 months from seattle to oakland because of a project i was on their miles plan is quite generous and i will continue to book with them consistently good things about alaska are their customer service quality always respectful and accommodating and ontime flight status not one single late flight with the exception of a bomb threat which isnt their fault consistent areas for improvement with alaska are their seat comfort the adjustable headrests are good on the larger planes but the smaller ones lack them and the seat bottoms across are painfully hard across the board  a 15 hour flight should not have me in physical pain at the end of it their wifi offerings there is no way i am paying 10 for slow internet access for 15 hours thats absurd and their mvp gold status is so heavily overloaded now that it seems like the majority of the flight is boarded early by them rather than normal flyers they need to consider revising how these points are earned and applied overall i have enjoyed them however and i will continue to use them for my return flights now that my weekly commute has moved to a seattletohouston trip there are no nonstop flights going to houston on sunday afternoons with alaska or its partner airlines so ill have to get there using continental and come back on alaska which is fine,ive fly alaska almost every monday morning thursday evening past 25 months seattle oakland project miles plan quite generous continue book consistently good things alaska customer service quality always respectful accommodating ontime flight status one single late flight exception bomb threat isnt fault consistent areas improvement alaska seat comfort adjustable headrests good larger planes smaller ones lack seat bottoms across painfully hard across board 15 hour flight physical pain end wifi offerings way paying 10 slow internet access 15 hours thats absurd mvp gold status heavily overloaded seems like majority flight boarded early rather normal flyers need consider revising points earned applied overall enjoyed however continue use return flights weekly commute moved seattletohouston trip nonstop flights going houston sunday afternoons alaska partner airlines ill get using continental come back alaska fine,POS
I flew 6 hrs from Seattle to Kona on a full flight. The only toilets for economy were at the back of the plane. Being only one narrow aisle there was continual crowding and congestion up the aisle near the toilets. It was particularly bad for passengers in the back rows because they had people in the aisle crowding them the whole flight. We were not allowed to use the first class facilities at the front even though a couple of people did go through. An other annoyance was the frequency and volume of announcements. Please let us have some peace and quiet! We noticed the contrast with Hawaiian Airlines which was so tranquil and relaxing with no loud publicity of special deals and unnecessary announcements of impending drinks trolley.,,,,,,i flew 6 hrs from seattle to kona on a full flight the only toilets for economy were at the back of the plane being only one narrow aisle there was continual crowding and congestion up the aisle near the toilets it was particularly bad for passengers in the back rows because they had people in the aisle crowding them the whole flight we were not allowed to use the first class facilities at the front even though a couple of people did go through an other annoyance was the frequency and volume of announcements please let us have some peace and quiet we noticed the contrast with hawaiian airlines which was so tranquil and relaxing with no loud publicity of special deals and unnecessary announcements of impending drinks trolley,flew 6 hrs seattle kona full flight toilets economy back plane one narrow aisle continual crowding congestion aisle near toilets particularly bad passengers back rows people aisle crowding whole flight allowed use first class facilities front even though couple people go annoyance frequency volume announcements please let us peace quiet noticed contrast hawaiian airlines tranquil relaxing loud publicity special deals unnecessary announcements impending drinks trolley,NEU

On return flight from Maui we sat in the first row behind 1st class. My wife needed to use the restroom and must use a crutch to walk so she went forward to 1st class. I went to the back but was blocked by 10 people in line who were blocked by the serving cart so I returned to the front. My wife had returned to her seat and another lady was going through the door so I waited. Then a lady attendant seeing me waiting told me I must go to the rear. I explained that the aisle was blocked by the serving cart she insisted I go back which I did. After the long wait on the serving cart I finally reached the restroom. When I returned to my seat the man in the aisle next to me asked why I went back. He said while I was gone 3 people had passed him and used the front bath room without any harassment.

I booked an Alaska flight for a short trip to San Jose CA from Los Angeles. I have never had an experience like the one I did on the return trip. 10 mins into the flight the cabin told us that due to a high volume of air traffic we would likely be delayed about 15-20 mins and would have to circle over LAX while waiting for a runway to open up. We end up circling over LAX for about 30 mins which wouldn't have been a big deal either except that we didn't land at LAX we landed at Long Beach about 30 mins away by car or 1hr 30mins with LA traffic). Then sat on the tarmac at Long Beach for nearly 2 hrs this is a 1 hr and 20 min flight to begin with and was given no information whatsoever about the airline's plans for us. When certain passengers were permitted to debark they were informed that they would be unable to retrieve their baggage from under the plane and would only be allowed to take their carryon out. Most of us had figured that the airline would probably shuttle us over to LAX. Word comes over the loudspeaker that we're flying back to LAX and will be there in about 1hr. I was expecting to meet an Alaska Airlines representative to explain to us that we would all get vouchers for cabs missed flights etc. no such luck. Not only did no one make an effort no one was even around. I couldn't find anyone from the airline other than the uninformed pilot and stewardesses.

First class Seat 4D on Seattle/Chicago run was horrible coming and going. Like sitting on a concrete bench. Not acceptable for First or Business Class. Also what's with the Board Room restrictions?

The flight departs from Concourse F and the upside to the airport is that there are only about a handful of flights departing from F that morning so TSA checkpoint a breeze.

"Vancouver to Portland on Horizon (Alaska Air's partner for the short hops on puddle jumper planes in the Northwest) on a Q400. Check-in went well with assurances that the flight was on time. Then once aboard our plane we sat and we sat at the gate until the pilot informed us that there was a mechanical problem. The passengers were allowed to return to the gate and await the problem's resolution a two-hour delay on a one-hour flight.

Due to booking a flight with Delta which sold the seats on Alaska beware. Alaska does not honour your original seats even though you resubmit and get confirmation of seat assignments. We had bought tickets for row 10 for my wife and I - Alaska decided to leave me in row 10 and at first had my wife in row 22 then row 28 after complaining the lady at the Kiosk put both of us in row 30 - the very rear. They do not seem to care much about customer relations. The flight was OK - on time etc.,,,,,,due to booking a flight with delta which sold the seats on alaska beware alaska does not honour your original seats even though you resubmit and get confirmation of seat assignments we had bought tickets for row 10 for my wife and i  alaska decided to leave me in row 10 and at first had my wife in row 22 then row 28 after complaining the lady at the kiosk put both of us in row 30  the very rear they do not seem to care much about customer relations the flight was ok  on time etc,due booking flight delta sold seats alaska beware alaska honour original seats even though resubmit get confirmation seat assignments bought tickets row 10 wife alaska decided leave row 10 first wife row 22 row 28 complaining lady kiosk put us row 30 rear seem care much customer relations flight ok time etc,NEU
Coming back from Maui to Sacramento we were able to buy a 1st class upgrade for $100 each. It was a pleasure to have the improved room and service of first class. The counter staff at the Maui airport were extremely helpful and courteous. The food and service were great compared to traveling in coach. We feel we had a great value.,,,,,,coming back from maui to sacramento we were able to buy a 1st class upgrade for 100 each it was a pleasure to have the improved room and service of first class the counter staff at the maui airport were extremely helpful and courteous the food and service were great compared to traveling in coach we feel we had a great value,coming back maui sacramento able buy 1st class upgrade 100 pleasure improved room service first class counter staff maui airport extremely helpful courteous food service great compared traveling coach feel great value,POS
