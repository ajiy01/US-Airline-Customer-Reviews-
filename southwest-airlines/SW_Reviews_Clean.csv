"✅ Trip Verified |  My father and I were scheduled for a flight out of Indianapolis to Atlanta, April 18, 2024, boarding 12:25pm B20, and sat for 2 hours waiting to hear our flight over the intercom but the flight was never announced to have changed to B21. We didn’t hear our names being called until 1:15pm but never heard that our flight had been changed to B21. We quickly got up out of our seats that were facing B20 and went up to the women at the counter and asked why our names were being called and they said we were too late just seconds after they had just called our names. Now I know they were being less than honest because the young lady hearing us out was also confused as to why our tickets read B20 when in fact it was B21. I never heard them make any changes to our flight, the flight was still there, and they had just called our names. I remember hearing countless updates for Tampa and Fort Meyers but never once did I hear Atlanta was being changed to B21.

"Not Verified |   On 3/19/2024, I encountered an unexpected issue while attempting to check in for a Southwest flight at the airport. Despite having booked my flight a month in advance on 02/12/2024 for a family funeral trip scheduled from 03/19 to 3/25, I was informed by a Southwest agent that I needed a consent form from my sisters to travel with my minor niece and nephew. This requirement was unfamiliar to me, as I had previously traveled with the minors on Southwest Airlines without encountering this request. The interaction with the agent and their supervisor was disheartening, as they exhibited rudeness and disrespect towards me. Despite my explanations and requests, they did not show a willingness to review my travel history with the minors or consider the circumstances of my family's bereavement. Additionally, I was given conflicting information about the acceptance of a notarized letter from the minors' guardian, causing further confusion and inconvenience. I respectfully request a review of this incident, as it has caused distress during an already challenging time. I hope that this feedback can contribute to improvements in customer service and clarity of travel requirements for passengers, particularly in sensitive situations such as family emergencies. I had a difficult experience with Southwest Airlines, as I was unable to board the flight and encountered unhelpful customer service. Despite this, I received a refund. I then booked with American Airlines and had a positive experience.

"Not Verified |  We had to rebook flights the day before flying due to a massive snowstorm. Our direct flight was changed to a connecting flight, but the connecting city was closer to our point of origin, so we just hopped in the rental car and drove. Little did we know that hidden in the fine print is a ""no show"" policy. If you don't cancel your flight and just don't show up, they cancel all flights on your itinerary, including your return flight. It doesn't matter that you already purchased your seats. They will take your money or points and leave you without a flight. What's more, if you purchase the highest price points tickets, they will refund your points, but if you purchase cheaper seats, they take your points. This feels like a poor penalty to me. We have been loyal Southwest customers for 20 years, including the credit card. No more. We are taking our business elsewhere.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I’ve flown bi-weekly for a year for work. I came back from a work conference this week with a bag one pound over the limit. I was told to pay $100 or to get a trash bag to check my items as a “separate package”. When I asked for a supervisor to clarify (since southwest allows for 2 free checked bags), the supervisor tried to guilt me by saying “you need to think of our staff who is on their hands and knees loading these bags. They don’t need to be moving overweight bags. Wouldn’t you agree? It’s unfair for a passenger to ask that of them?” Ma’am- it was one pound and I know your policy allows for heavier bags for your elite members. Do you pay the employee the $100 you asked me to pay if they have to “get on their hands and knees” to lift a bag one pound over? I’ve seen how these bags are handled. Southwest broke a family heirloom on my last flight with them because of how rough they are. Don’t try to make me feel bad because I was told to put my items in a trash bag and hope they arrived. I’ll never fly southwest again. I appreciate the supervisor’s ability to argue- but don’t act like it’s because the airline cares about their staff. It’s a way to make money.

"Not Verified |   Horrible experience. Our original flight time was 11:30am. They delayed it to 2:00pm. We were fine until we arrived at the airport. They delayed our flight to 7:28pm! That's about 8 hours after we were supposed to leave. The weather wasn't even bad. It was beautiful outside and there was no storms at all. The delay was due to ""Air traffic control"" even though no other airline such as Delta or United had delayed or canceled flights. After waiting an hour at the airport, they cancelled our flight and would not give us a refund at first. We had a week long trip ahead of us that we couldn't go on because of Southwest. We also saw families of 8 going to Disney World Orlando and you can't get a refund from that either. Now we are trying to cancel everything we had planned for the trip.

"✅ Trip Verified |  This review is for the Southwest hotel concierge. I usually book hotels through Southwest for the rewards points. On the last booking of 12/23, I was charged an additional $900+ the day after checking out. I made two inquiries to Southwest as to why and the first response was a link to understanding hotel charges. The second expressed concern, asked for proof, which I sent a copy of my credit card statement, and was told to expect a reply answer in 3 to 5 business days which never came. I replied to this email 3 weeks later asking for an update and then 2 weeks after since I did not get a reply, nothing yet. All I asked was for a reason as why the double charge.

"Not Verified |   We had the worst flight attendant on flight 1735, we were told that if we paid extra to board early we can save seats for our family members. The flight attendant was so rude and said that the person at the ticket counter wasn’t a flight attendant. She then signaled people to sit on the seats we were saving for 2 family members, one of us is disabled and the other one is partial medical injured. She was so condescending and rude, even made a comment that “if I can stop being Interrupted, I can get back to my introduction” - not the attitude of a flight attendant. I’m beginning to think that these flight attendant’s instigate negative energy in order to create a hostile atmosphere so that they can kick you off the plane if you say something.

"Not Verified |  I was very disappointed with the flight attendants. They were complaining about their lack of pay and that they didn’t get paid equally to the pilots. They were also complaining about the fact that they didn’t get paid until the passengers were all seats and the door was closed. I don’t think they should have been complaining about the airline not taking care of them. Let alone in front of customers. This went on for almost the entire 3 hours of the flight. It must be a big problem as the connecting flight was also a discussion the same topic.  I really didn’t want to hear about their problems of work. I did contact customer service to find out that they were not willing to listen and referring me to the airline website. So I did, only to receive an automated email back. Stating they were sorry for any inconvenience. Needless to say I am not going to make the return trip with this airline. It may cost more but I guess you do get what you pay for.

"Not Verified |  I Fly fairly regularly with Southwest and up to now my experiences with them have always been very good. Usually a reasonable price, Always good and friendly people to help out when something goes wrong. I once missed my flight out of Orlando at Christmas time - I was horrified but they managed to get me on another flight and although I had been really upset they made me believe it was not a problem to them at all. So to return to yesterdays flight from Houston to Orlando. Everything about the flight was fine, on time, seating etc great. But I have to say the flight attendant was amazingly funny.

"Not Verified |  Customer Service was poor on my last flight. I was flying from Panama City to New York (LGA) with a connection in Nashville on a Saturday. My first flight was fine (in flight beverages and entertainment not great, but I have come to expect this with Southwest). My second flight got delayed 3/4 times before ultimately being cancelled at 8.30pm. Again, not usually an issue, but they were unable to rebook me until Monday. The service desk was not able to get me on a flight the next day at all and also wouldn't let me get on standby for any of the Sunday flights. I was willing to accept this, however, I had no place to stay in Nashville. When I requested a comped or discounted hotel room (especially considering I was going to need somewhere to stay for two nights) they declined siting weather as the reason for cancelation, therefore they didn't need to provide hotel accommodation. While I understand what's in their contract, it is an absolutely awful customer experience to be stranded in a city where you have no connections and are essentially forced to pay for a hotel or sleep in an airport for over 24 hours. I would have expected them to either pay for my hotel or try a bit harder to get my on a flight the following day and not two days later. When this has happened to me on other airlines, they have always provided a hotel room free of charge and tried their best to get me on a flight the very next day, regardless of the reason for the cancellation. I ultimately had to cancel my return flight and get a rental car to get myself home. (at an additional cost of several hundred dollars). I will think twice before booking with Southwest again.

I’ve never bothered to do early check in bc I’m priority boarding but decided to do it this time since it’s w a different airline then what I’m use to. My youngest being a 5 year old girl was given a seat in C24 when her brothers were placed in C11 and C 12. So naturally I called the airlines. The lady said she couldn’t change her seat. I asked what about priority boarding for unaccompanied minors (the 8 and 5 year old) she shut that down. I explained I need my kids to sit together please. I asked about priority boarding for military. I explained they have military ID cards and I will have mine on me as I plan to wait with them at the gate to see them off. She said “Sorry but no priority boarding for them, we don’t do that.” She was so rude. I explained these kids are new to this routine and it is the 5-year old first time flying w/o mommy with her. The southwest rep could not care less saying that there’s nothing she can do for us! I was very angry.

"Not Verified |  The day started with a notice while we were departing our cruise ship notifying us of a delay on our flight from Houston to San Diego. We noticed the change reduced our layover to 40 minutes, so we headed directly to the airport to give us time to resolve the conflict. We arrived 6 hours before our scheduled time, so I stood in line for over an hour to discuss the issue with the over-worked agent who told me that my best bet was to keep the schedule as she didn't see anything that was better. This phrase came up a lot, but their agents are clearly trained to tell clients that they don't have control of the weather, etc. regarding delays. The only flights from Southwest that were delayed were those to San Diego (it was not weather related as the flights to and from San Diego were also on schedule except ours). After waiting until we could check luggage (4.5hrs), we went through security to our gate only to see the delay had been extended (5 minute layover). Agent 2 told me that she could only find another flight with 1 seat headed to Boise, but she could only see Houston connections, so I called their 800 number. 3rd agent was an explanation followed by hold/hang-up. 4th agent was actually willing to change the flights to another option, but because we checked baggage #4 (the only person willing to help us) had to send me back to the terminal agents with the flight information. 5th agent is unwilling to change the flight because the plane from San Diego to Boise has 17 passengers and is going to wait for us. I asked if we could be boarded in front or so we could make our connection, but that would be unfair to everyone else, so we sat in the back. I knew I was being lied to, but at this point I figured I'd just wait to see what would happen. We fly to San Diego to find a nice message once we were off airplane mode about how our flight left and we were given new boarding passes for a later flight along with a $100 voucher for a later flight (YAY!). I looked at my pass and it was an ""A"" position which was nice and handed off the other 3 for our family to my wife and went in search of food (terminal was super crowded due to construction) so we grabbed some snacks and found a spot on the floor to sit. I mentioned how it was nice that we didn't get boarded last and my son tells me his pass was C-30 and his girlfriend was C-15. I took our passes to the 7th agent (6 was for new passes) and expressed that it was ridiculous that my family was not set to board together. She immediately went off about how unfair it was for other passengers. I stated that my original tickets were in the A group for that leg of the flight (in an irritated voice), but she stuck to her argument. At this point, I was done with their service, so I expressed to her that I had spent the better part of 12 hours trying to get them to correct the issue and completely ignored. She threatened me regarding getting on the plane and finally got me a supervisor. The supervisor #8 and I had a long discussion regarding the situation and continued down the road of unfairness, but she would allow us to board together. She mentioned the $100 vouchers, but why would I ever fly with them again - I'd pay not to (and told her so). She also asked why I didn't ask for a supervisor - Isn't that their job when they can't help a customer? Flying with Southwest is just not worth the trouble.

We were ecstatic! Since my fiancé was saving for a ring I was in charge of purchasing the flights. I hurried to purchase them but then we found out housing was pretty expensive so we switched out flight to another island on the deal. Little did I know switching made the deal invalid. This wasn't mentioned in the email. I did notice it cost extra but thought the deal was still on there so the total couldn't be too much (this was my first time scheduling a flight and I was under time pressure so I was a bit naïve). After paying the difference, I looked a the confirmation email and saw that the total was $1250! I was working so I rushed to an office and got a hold of customer service and they told me that piece of information about changing flight locations. Apparently a lot of people were experiencing the same issue. I started crying explaining that I had no idea the deal wasn't applied and if there was any way I could get my money back. They said that if I canceled I could only get flight credit. I hung up and called my fiancé right away. I was bawling my eyes out explaining how I had messed up our honeymoon and we could never afford the trip at full cost. After that phone call I had to go back to work like everything was okay. I know I was a bit naïve but I still feel scammed out of my honeymoon.

"Not Verified |  Treated very badly re: damaged luggage. My (almost new) bag was destroyed. I reported it at the airport and followed up as requested, via their portal. First was offered a travel voucher. Don’t want that. Then I was asked for a receipt for the purchase. I replied that it was a gift I received 2 months ago. Do not have a receipt. I provided the cost for an exact replacement . Then I was offered a very depreciated amount. I asked how they came to that amount (formula - age, cost etc). They did not reply. I called to try to escalate this issue several times. Phone agents were of no help at all. Just said work thru the portal. After a month I was told they would no longer reply to me and my case was closed. Very poor customer experience. I think my request was very reasonable.

"✅ Trip Verified | Upon family boarding my daughter and I sat in the first 2 rows of the aircraft, we boarded the plane early. I put both our carry ons above us. I was soon interrupted by an un-helpful, nasty flight attendant stating you need to get you bag up or I have to check it. I quickly got my bag in and it fit fine, the woman watched me struggle with no help. Then after the plane had fully been boarded someone boarded the plane that also wanted their carry on to fit, my bag was then removed and placed further in back to place their bag where mine was. After drinks were served my daughter and I weren’t able to finish our drinks as a different flight attendant wanted to take our garbage and said we weren’t allowed to finish our drinks. When we were leaving the plane I asked the flight attendant where my bag was and I was told they didn’t know, and now I we had to wait until the entire aircraft un-boarded so I could get my bag. Once I was able to locate my bag it was in the exact position it originally was in but further back in the aircraft. My daughter and I were treated very poorly as we exited the aircraft by the flight attendant with a snarky, condescending tone “have a nice day”.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew out from Denver International to Fort Myers, Florida with my 2 young great grand kids. For verification I asked an off duty Flight Attendant what gate we were to fly out of. She looked at my ticket and told me C25 and pointed. We made our way over with me hobbling in horrible pain as it was hard to walk. As it got closer to the time to board I didn't notice any signs of Ft. Myers, Florida so I went to the desk and asked the gentleman what was going on. He looked at my ticket and said I misread it and that my gate was C64 - the opposite end of the airport. We took off at a dead run and ran the whole way even through 3 conveyor walk ways while he radioed ahead that ""there's a woman and two children running your way."" All I could think about was making this flight. As I got closer I heard 3 times, ""Flight 1383 to Fort Myers is fully boarded and if you want to make this flight then you need to come now or the door would be permanently locked."" I was frantic. When we got there the gal taking the ticket asked me how I felt and that I was blue around my mouth and she needed me to get stabilized with oxygen before she would let me on the plane. I received oxygen for about 10 - 15 minutes then boarded. Two flight attendants not only held the plane for me but saved me 3 seats together in the back of the plane. I've only flown Southwest except for one time with Frontier. I will always fly Southwest. I love Southwest and their cancellation policy, baggage perks and loyalty points with my membership. Thank you to the flight attendants for helping me in this pinch. You were so compassionate and helpful, above and beyond the call of duty. You are assets to Southwest.

"Not Verified |  Allow me to share my recent experience that left me deeply disappointed. My boarding pass clearly stated that I needed to be on the plane by 3:20 PM, as the scheduled departure time was 3:32 PM. However, due to the disorganized nature of the TSA, it took an astonishing 45 minutes for me to place my personal belongings on the tray for scanning. To compound the situation, the TSA officials encountered difficulties while scanning my daughter's belongings. As I anxiously watched the clock, it took them an additional 20 minutes to complete the task. Finally, I arrived at the gate at 3:13 PM, a respectable 7 minutes before the designated boarding time mentioned on my boarding pass. To my dismay, however, the door had already been closed, and I, along with approximately 8 other passengers who had faced similar delays with TSA, were denied boarding. Consequently, I missed my flight to Ft Lauderdale and had to hastily book a flight to Orlando at 7 PM, which landed at 10:30 PM. On top of that, I had to endure a tiring 2.5-hour drive to WPB, knowing that I had work the next day. As a frequent traveler, missing a plane was a first for me, and it has left me with a strong resolve never to fly with Southwest again. What truly bewilders me is the stark contrast in treatment when delays occur. On numerous occasions, I have arrived on time only to experience flight delays for various reasons. As customers, we are expected to accept such inconveniences, but the differential treatment when delays happen to us is disheartening. Southwest has unequivocally lost my business. To add insult to injury, I had to personally retrieve my luggage from the Ft Lauderdale airport since I was not eligible for free delivery.

"Not Verified |  I am handicapped in that I have significant arthritis in just about every joint and am 85 years old. I asked for a wheelchair when I booked the flight, as I always do. This time when I arrived at the airport in Philadelphia to return home (this was a round trip booking) I checked in at the counter and reminded them that I had signed up for a wheelchair. She told me to sit down and one would arrive. This seemed normal as I have always traveled on Southwest and this was the routine. Well, I sat there for over half an hour, periodically asking a variety of Southwest personnel about the wheelchair. They said it was ""on the way"". When my plane was scheduled to board in 10 minutes I began to panic. When I asked at the desk again, the woman said, ""why don't you just walk?"" I was beginning to think that they thought I could walk to the gate and through security and were not going to provide the wheelchair I needed. At that point I saw a person with a wheelchair and no one in it. I asked her if she could take me to my gate as the plane was about to board and she said she ""worked for ...... airline and couldn't take southwest passengers"". Then she said that If I could walk to the nearby elevator she could take me. She told me not to get into the wheelchair until the elevator door closed and then she took me to the gate. The plane was boarding. It was very clear that, had I not approached this person and practically begged her to take me, I would have missed my plane, my connecting flight and heaven knows when I could have gotten home. This would be a disaster for me given my inability to navigate myself anywhere except short distances, not to mention what to do with my dogs at home whose sitter had to leave for another job. I am disgusted with Southwest and I never thought I would say this, but there is no excuse for what was just totally ignoring my disability needs.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I am quite disappointed with Southwest. I and several members of my company have been flying Southwest for the past several years because the service and convenience had been exemplary particularly when taking into account the reasonable pricing. I have seen its attributes in many way degrade and some of the competitors improve their standards. I was particularly dismayed after having left my briefcase and phone on a flight on May 16th, 2023. After filing a lost report soon after deplaning, I received no helpful assistance from the airline other than an email three days later stating that they were looking into it and should consider the case close if no further notice had been received withing 30 days. Misplacing a phone these days does not only cause a significant financial impact but the information contained may be critical. For this reason, a more definitive answer than the nonchalant response from Southwest baggage supervisor at Midway Airport stating that they would be drowned in lost items that they receive daily then added 40-50 things including I-Pads, phones, and other items. This statement struck me as particularly irritating since the two individuals at the office were sitting without no apparent task at the time. With the concern that she displayed, I must conclude that the case is probably lost and that the decision to purchase another phone (regardless of cost) should be undertaken. I would have hoped that they might ask me to text my phone to more quickly identify the fact that they may or may not have it in their procession now at the Alabama location where all the lost items from all the Southwest flights go (now many thousands of items per day instead of 40-50).

"Not Verified |  I recently had the misfortune of flying with Southwest Airlines, and I must say that my experience was nothing short of a disappointment. From the moment I stepped foot onto their plane, it was evident that this airline lacks the professionalism and commitment to customer satisfaction that one would expect. First and foremost, Southwest Airlines had no regard for punctuality. My flight was delayed once, and then they decided to rebook it for an unreasonably early hour in the morning. This unexpected change disrupted my entire travel plans and left me feeling exhausted before I even boarded the aircraft. It is unacceptable for an airline to make such drastic alterations without a valid reason or proper compensation. To make matters worse, Southwest's servers seemed to be in a state of disarray. Throughout the booking process, I encountered multiple technical glitches and slow response times on their website. It was frustrating to witness a company of this scale failing to maintain their online infrastructure, leading to additional stress and wasted time on my end. The flight itself was another disappointing aspect of my experience. The plane's condition was subpar. Southwest Airlines made a promise to compensate me for the inconvenience caused by their multiple delays and rebooking. They specifically mentioned a $200 voucher, which I was eagerly looking forward to. However, even after reaching out to their customer service department, I was met with indifference and received no resolution. It is disheartening to be on the receiving end of such false promises, especially when they have a direct impact on the customer experience. In conclusion, my experience with Southwest Airlines was marred by their unprofessionalism, lack of punctuality, technical glitches, and broken promises. I strongly advise potential travelers to consider alternative options and avoid the frustrations and disappointments that come with flying this airline.

"✅ Trip Verified |  In 2007 Southwest served: 64.9 million cans of soda, juices, and water 11.3 million alcoholic beverages 6.1 million bags of pretzels 103.8 million bags of peanuts 14 million snackpacks 32 million other snacks Just think how much money Southwest would save if they stopped offering all those ""free"" drinks but then the public would go crazy.  Our beverage service has been canceled on probably 8 out of the last 10 flights I have been on.  And no I don't fly the same place so its not likely due to a specific route. But - if you do the math - Southwest is lost a TON of money due to the Christmas Flight debacle last year.  An average soda costs about $0.75 - $1.00 for the airlines, once you factor in the cost of the drink itself (they purchase cans), the cup, and the ice (which isnt much).  On average a flight has about 150 passengers - that's easily $112 - $150 they can put in their pocket when they ""cancel"" beverage service - and that's assuming each passenger only has one drink. On a recent flight (the one I'm on as I write this) - we were once again denied this ""freebie"" service in the name of supposed ""turbulence"" despite a relatively smooth flight.  I've heard others mention that the captain is the one who makes that decision, so I asked. When I asked about this, instead of simply answering my question, letting me know that the captain made the decision, etc. the flight attendant said something like ""let me find out"".   A few minutes later, the captain came on and ""explained"" why he felt it was important to cancel service - essentially providing an excuse for why they did this.  When I asked for the captain's name, so i could verify this with SWA customer service, I was met with another flight attendant who basically told me ""were not going to do that"" and refused to give me his name. He also threatened that they would ""divert the plane""  although I was extremely calm and was seated in my seat, not yelling or anything.  I guess I was talking loud enough for other passengers to hear - can't have more than one passenger figure out the little secret. Although I dont know what they are so worried about.  Most of the passengers on the plane will never even tell their friend or a significant other about the experience, let alone do anything that could actually make a difference (like report this on social media or via customer service). But still you dont have to ""hide"" and refuse to provide your name if you aren't doing anything wrong.  So this is all being done in the name of ""safety"" - lets go with that.

Because of the droves of people around the woman calling out boarding information, I could not hear her. She used a tiny microphone which actually none of us could hear. She then chose to yell out information which no one could hear either. Being my first time flying SW, I unfortunately, hadn’t researched how they board people. I had no idea where “C” was and asked around to finally find where my boarding area was. There was a fellow “C” woman who moved around, so I followed her.

"✅ Trip Verified | I normally really enjoy flying Southwest, but over the last year or so I have acquired a bad taste for them. I flew 11 May 2023 from BWI to Tulsa through St. Louis and I paid for Business Select so I could be in the first boarding group. When I checked in I was A01, which would mean I could get to my choice seat early and get my bag in an overhead bin. Yet there were 20 pre boarders on the first leg and 18 on the second leg - many who walked into the plane (only 5 wheel chairs total) The boarding process has become a joke as pre boarders, sit in the front 3-5 rows. So I think I'm going to request that every time I fly now because I pay $100 or so extra to get first choice of seat and overheard, yet that is no longer available because ALL pre borders have forced those who pay extra to sit in what's left.

"✅ Trip Verified |  SouthWest has left my wife and I stranded in Seattle on our way to our honeymoon to Bali. Flight changes for our international flight now cost 5K and southwest says they are not responsible for flight delays and inability to get me to my destinations on time! I have never had such a negative overall experience during my travels that I had to take a moment just to air out the grievance at 4AM while still traveling.  A short hour flight became a 3-hour overall flight due to inclement weather and being re-routed to Grand Rapids Michigan. I understand that inclement weather cannot be controlled and safety is priority. One would assume as a purchaser of a connecting flight that when a portion of that flight is off schedule the airline will adjust as needed to still get the customer to their destination in a timely manner. I was not given any reasonable options as I was on my way to catch an international flight to Bali, Indonesia and had to be in LAX by 4AM, I was given a ticket to get into LAX at 9:30AM. Adjustments were made to get me flown to Seattle after waiting all night to get my bags in order to re-check them I was treated extremely poorly by the check-in bag personnel who was training another employee. She was very curt, abrasive, dry, and mean.

"Not Verified |  I had a horrible trip. I booked a trip from Oakland Ca. to Savannah Ga. in Nov. 2022. I HATE flying early, so I booked a flight that had a reasonable, late-morning departure and paid the extra money for a better schedule. About a week before my trip in April of 2023, Southwest canceled my flights and rebooked my whole trip. So, I had to get up at 3.30am to be at the airport by 4.30am for my new take-off time of 5.55am. Exactly what I didn't want and paid extra to avoid. There was no refund for my extra payment when they forced me onto the early undesirable schedule. Then.... On my return home from Savannah, our plane was delayed taking off at the Savannah airport. It turns out the fuel truck for our plane didn't have enough fuel in it. Seriously. So they went and got more fuel and then refuelled our plane which caused a delay to our connection in Houston. We would have had 9 minutes (given the delay for fuelling) to catch our flight in Houston, but Southwest elected to keep the plane to Oakland on time and leave us behind. Great. Now we are rebooked through Southwest for a flight the next day and we are in Houston overnight. And guess what? I have to get on a plane at 6.15am which is exactly why I paid extra money for my original schedule to avoid. The representative at the Houston airport was really nice (Angie G.) and we got a hotel voucher and a $200 Southwest voucher. But this just isn't enough. I'm arriving 16 hours late. I'm staying in a city overnight that I don't care to be in, and cutting my sleep for the second time in a week to keep a flight schedule that I didn't authorize or sign up for. I paid my pet sitter $200 to stay the night in my home and take care of my pets unexpectedly for the extra night. Where is the actual compensation for the 16 hours of my life that I spent overnight in Houston? I had to eat. I had to pay my pet sitter. I lost sleep and essentially, I lost an entire day of rest at home before my work week. This is just awful. I don't know what is going on with this airline, but I have no interest in your voucher to plan a trip with you ever.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I paid for a business select ticket obviously more than an economy ticket only to find out that this does not get you any better class of seat, all I got in exchange for more than double the price was the opportunity to board the plane first.

"Not Verified |  The very worst I have ever been treated was on Southwest Airlines in Baltimore. It was between flights and I needed a wheelchair. We had requested a wheelchair in advance but there wasn’t one available. It took a long time to get to the next flight and the agent for the next flight was rude and treated us like we were the worst passengers ever for being late to the gate.

The agent did not like my comment and she decided to use her power to punish me. I will never forget this as long as I live.

"✅ Trip Verified | I entered Premium Economy as I paid the fee to upgrade my boarding status so I could get a seat in the front of the plane on a preferred aisle seat. This was fine in Cancun but, when I was to board in Houston passengers who were taken off the plane were allowed to board prior to those of us who had paid for the priority boarding/seats and occupied the forward seats despite most not having paid for the seats. This also occurred when departing Nashville. The only difference being the passengers continuing on who came in on the flight were allowed to remain on the plane and improve their seats prior to our boarding. I was forced to more than halfway back in the plane. If these people are continuing on, they should board in the respective class with those boarding at the gate. Southwest is basically stealing the upgrade fee as their terrible policy of disregarding those have paid for early boarding despite those who improve their seats without paying for the privilege.

"✅ Trip Verified | I’m pretty sure that Southwest can not afford to continue to lose passengers. I traveled with a 10 week old puppy. I paid the fee $95. Which I was ok with until they said I had to check my bag because she counts as my carry on. If she counts as my carry on why is there a fee. She’s not taking up any extra space. She weighs less than a normal carry on as well. I was told she had to be under the seat for take off and landing but on the plane the flight attendant was extremely rude. She told me she had to go back in her pet carrier. I explained what I was told and she continued to be extremely rude. I proceeded to put her back in her carrier under the seat, where she remained. The flight attendant came back to ask me my last name and then asked if I ‘she was even a paid pet’. I proceeded to show her my receipt and the tag on the carrier. Stated if she was that concerned she should have checked when I boarded and not half way through the flight. I had my jacket on my lap and every time she passed by made me lift my jacket to show she wasn’t on my lap. Which she never was - she remained in the carrier for the remainder of the flight. They have lost another customer due to very rude employees. If the rule is they have to stay in the carrier for the duration of the flight that should be clearly communicated when checking in. Also there is always a polite way to deal with customers but the employees continue to be unnecessarily rude. I will make sure to tell everyone that travels with pets my experience from now on.

"✅ Trip Verified | What is going on with SW?? On a return flight from Puerto Rico to Denver, Southwest canceled the second leg of our flight out of Tampa, while we're in the air to Tampa, citing ""weather"". After doing much research and having our local news look into this, it appears that only the SW flights were canceled into Denver, other airlines were arriving as scheduled. The actual statistic for that evening were 47% of SW flights were cancelled into Denver and less than 5% of other airlines were cancelled. The FAA did not issue any closures or delays to Denver. I can't imagine why weather would be an excuse when no one else was using it. After talking to the agents, we kept being told that there were no other flights that evening, when in reality, there were. We just weren't offered those flights. And yes, there was availability according to the website. And they weren't canceled! We received some of the most unapologetic, uncaring, and disingenuous treatment from Southwest Airlines across the board. From the gate agent to the ticketing agent to the baggage agent to the customer service rep. After leaving the airport (because our flight was changed to a 5AM flight the following day), I called to inquire again if there were better flights, I had to wait ONE to TWO hours just to speak to a live person. Our options to return were an early morning flight or an evening flight for a non-stop flight. There was no way I was going to chance taking a flight with a layover anywhere, Southwest is not to be trusted and I didn’t want to get into a situation where we were then stranded at yet another airport. I don’t know what is going on with Southwest and why their business model is falling apart. SW used to be my “go-to” airline (we even had the credit card but have since retired it due to the airline’s inconsistency with flights). If SW thinks it's ok to strand passengers in random places just to make their “customary playbook” profitable, then they are not focusing on what is important. The local news received a disingenuous reply from a SW rep regarding our situation but also showed some telling facts: ""Many of the flights we proactively canceled at the start of today were in anticipation of operational conditions in Denver."" Southwest cancelled our flight in the morning and we were not notified until we were in the air on our way to Tampa. If we had been notified we would have chosen to stay (at our own expense) in San Juan to spend more time with our family, but we were not given that option. Other airlines always lets us know when a flight is going to be delayed or cancelled and they do this in advance and they let us change our flight to a time that works for us. SW does not offer this. Their system is antiquated and not user-friendly. We are disgusted with the treatment we received. They are losing loyal customers left and right. Why do they keep treating your passengers this way?

"✅ Trip Verified | I had SWA tickets from ONT to ATL with a connection in Dallas. Southwest clearly lost control of their operation on 1/30-31 and stranded me in Vegas. Ok, there was ice in Dallas, but I would have been happy to keep my hotel room and car another day to avoid being stranded. They kept telling me to come to the airport as they had rescheduled my flight. Instead they cancelled my flight FIVE times and promised me each time that I could reach my destination on time. I asked if there was any chance of missing my connection and SW said no. I think they were fabricating stories because they got me to give up my hotel room, rental car. One time in ONT they pushed off from the gate and rode around on the runway and then parked right back at the gate. It was hot in the plane and full of fumes. I got sick on the plane. Once parked again I got off the plane and tried to talk to some one, ANYONE, who could help but there was just one ticket person and a long line of angry customers. I never was able to schedule another connection in Ontario. At one point they said they would take my luggage off the plane and then said they wouldnt. So I got back on the plane prefering to be stranded with luggage rather than without. These Southwest people are rude and crude and have no idea what they are telling people! Why do they feel they have to tell people things that aren't true? Is it just some power trip and they enjoy wrecking the plans of their customers? Anyhow, I eventually landed in Vegas and once again there was no one who knew what was going on. No one could tell me how to get home to Atlanta. I had a boarding pass for the flight to Atlanta but when I tried to use it they said the boarding pass was no good. Some SWA jerk grabbed it out of my hands and said ""Hmm, it says it's for Atlanta"". Anyhow, they told me to go talk to customer service so I lost my seating assignment. At ""customer service"" they printed out another ticket and said to go get on the plane. I tried and again the boarding pass was not working. The whole time they were acting as if this was my fault, even though it was their obvious flawed way of doing things. Any airline this bad should not be allowed to fly. They are completely unsympathetic. Just rude and nasty if you express simple concerns about your schedule or luggage. In one breath they blame it on flight control, tell you what flight to get on, and then it all turns out to be bogus information. Keep in mind that Southwest perpetuated this mess over three days. Maybe somewhere someone was working on it but you could have fooled me. They looked like idiots and no one had any confidence in what they were saying. Southwest made a lot of people desperate for no reason. Ok, there was ice in Dallas but Southwest made the situation 10 times worse by telling people their flights were still taking off and convincing people to come to the airport. This made some people a bit panicky for no reason other than a few airline people wanting to look like they had all the answers.

"✅ Trip Verified |  My wife and I have been traveling on Southwest for nearly three decades and generally appreciate their service or that they do their best to be helpful when travel plans go sideways. In fact we just had a trip through Southwest Vacations that was fantastic. Our latest experience with them, however, has been both eye-opening and frustrating. We had booked flights for February 2nd from Puerto Vallarta to Reno with a connection in Phoenix. We had flight 1299 from Puerto Vallarta to Phoenix and then flight 547 from Phoenix to Reno. We received an email from Southwest notifying us that our flights were changed from Puerto Vallarta to Denver and then Denver to Reno. We had seen this Denver connection when we were initially booking our trip however we did not want to fly from Mexico to Denver in the dead of the winter. Too much of a chance of being stuck in Mexico. I went on the Southwest website and could see that our original flights through Phoenix and on to Reno were still there and they were still selling tickets for these flights. I called Southwest customer service and asked that our flights be changed back to our original flights. The customer service representative changed us back to the original 1299 flight Puerto Vallarta to Phoenix but informed us (here’s where things got wonky) that we could no longer choose our original Phoenix to Reno flight 547 because the two flights were no longer ‘linked’ in their system. I asked her what she meant by that. Apparently, Southwest links certain flights together so when you search for a flight from A to B with a connection in between it will only show you these ‘linked’ flights. There may be other connecting flights that are departing earlier or later depending on your needs but you will not see them because they are not linked flights in their system. So our original flights were ‘linked’ when we booked them but were then ‘unlinked’ and changed by Southwest to Denver. And when I tried to change them back I was told that is no longer an option because those two flights are no longer linked. The only ‘linked’ flight through Phoenix was a 5-hour and 20 minute layover in Phoenix and then a flight stopping in Vegas and traveling on to Reno. I pointed out to Southwest that there was an earlier flight 867 through Vegas and on to Reno with only a 2 hour and 10 minute layover. I was told that was not an option because that was not a ‘linked’ flight. Seriously! You changed our flights! You un-linked our original flights and refuse to do anything to restore our original flights or alleviate the lengthy delay you left us with. C’mon Southwest you can do better. At the end of most flights the flight attendant will say ""We know you have a choice in flying and we thank you for flying Southwest."" And so my wife and I will spend our 5 hour and 20 minute layover contemplating our future travel plans and considering if it's time to exercise that choice.

✅ Trip Verified |  I have had more than one issue with Southwest the past 3 times and am absolutely disgusted. I was forced to give up my seat to other people after I boarded first as an A class member. Then the airline lost my luggage on my flight home because it turns out they decided not to put it on the plane and when I was told it would arrive and I would be contacted I wasn't. I was called at 12am and woken up. Then I had booked a flight home Dec 22-29 to fly home after life saving surgery to spend Christmas with my family until my flight was canceled twice so I ended up having to spend Christmas alone and lost money due to paid appointments thanks to Southwest. I rebooted my flight and requested assistance which was not given after I specifically told them I couldn't lift per Dr. Orders but didn't get help until second time where I had to go through security again andI had to pay fora carry on bag. I was told I would get a flight credit due to SW canceling my trip because they sent my mom one. When I called to ask about it again they told me I don't get one after I had been waiting for the email I was promised. I am beyond disgusted as a customer and if the situation is not handled I will not be using SW again and will make sure to tell everyone I know not to use them either. They are a dishonest company who doesn't care about their customers or taking care of them as promised. I understand mistakes happen but what happened to me is not acceptable and won't be tolerated.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Stellar Employees at Southwest, ground crew, attendants, Pilots etc. True dedication to their work and doing their best during these challenging times. Our Flight was delayed multiple times, during that time I was able to do some research as to what was going on. Due to severe storm activity across the country many airlines had to cancel flights. Southwest included. I understand people being upset, but what I appreciate is Southwests ongoing communication to let their passengers know ahead of time that the Airline and Flights were experiencing ""Irregular Operations"", they clearly assure their passengers ahead of time: ""If your flight was canceled and you would like a refund, please submit a request"". So I went fully knowing my flight could be cancelled. Of course multiple delays, the ground crew communicated with us multiple times, telling us they were doing what they could, that something had happened to their network. could have it been hacked? or challenges with having to cancel flights due to storm activity? Regardless, this airline wouldn't have cancelled if they felt the airways were safe, or they had the capacity.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed flight 3x just to be told it's cancelled literally 30 seconds before boarding. We waited hours in line to rebook the next flight tomorrow.

I checked my email and ""surprise"", they cancelled it last minute before boarding. I feel bad for the passengers who had hope and stayed waiting all night.

"✅ Trip Verified |  On Saturday 12/24 I was at the airport by 10:15 for my 12:15 boarding of Flt 2909 to Manchester. I'm always early. It was delayed to 1:45 then cancelled by 11:30. Got on line, no flights to Manchester so I booked one to Boston that stopped in Tennessee first, I think that was Flt 3223 scheduled for 5:45 PM & landing after midnight. I took it. I will pay the $200 + for car service to get to New Hampshire. I went downstairs got my bags from the Manchester flt & checked them for the Boston Flight. Went through security again. At 3:30 that flight cancelled. They told me I could rebook for Monday morning flt 3159 several stops but you stay on the plane to Boston get in 6 hours later. I booked it. I was told my bags would be downstairs again. I went downstairs was told over & over again by the staff downstairs my bags would be down as soon as they could. 8 hours later when the baggage doors closed I was told no more bags coming down I could speak to a manager but there were no managers downstairs, I could go upstairs. I did & guess what, no manager there either. I went home bagless & exhausted. I asked at least ten time & was told the bags will be here. There was no real security watching these bags I had the Christmas gifts for my family in one bag & all my winter clothes in the other. I would have left, if I felt they would be secure. I wish I had. I stayed home Christmas my 3rd flt was cancelled. I tried calling Southwest on hold the first time 3 hours had to hang up & then 4 hours on hold & then disconnected. I went back to the airport on 12/26. Got on line 7:15AM to try again, to get a flt. to Manchester. I was on that line for 4.5 hours. The reason it was so long is that we were not important to Southwest They had 3- sometimes 4 employees at the counter & 3 & sometime all 4 of the Southwest employees would take the A list people that just walked into there lane, that haven't waited more then 5 minutes. So basically the group of over 150 to over 200 people were left with sometimes, one person, who was at the end of the counter, to assist them in finding a new flight. How disgusting! How belittling to treat your customers with such disrespect. I finally rebooked & now for the last time I'm going to try to get to Manchester on 12/28. Now, I go downstairs to get my luggage, you know it, not happening. Its no where to be found, so what are my options a line, 2 hours later, I get into the luggage counter and ask, where is my luggage? My last flight was flight cancelled yesterday? Well the young man says, one bag in is Boston & one is still in Tampa. I didn't go to Boston but my bag got a spot? I told him the other bag is not here I looked for it several times. He said well it could be on a cart somewhere & we don't have the staff to look for it. You had the staff to send one of them to Boston? Was it an A list bag? I asked how do I get my bags? He said once you land in Manchester you can request your bags. What? Now you want me to get in line in another state? I know that Boston doesn't fly to Manchester? So what you're telling me, is they will fly my bags somewhere else & then to Manchester? Do I get the mileage points or do my bags get them?

"✅ Trip Verified | We are family of three (myself, husband and our infant) and frequent Southwest travelers since last 7 years. We were scheduled to fly out to and fro to Dallas from LGA on Thursday (Dec 22, 2022). Before we even started to the airport our flight got cancelled. It makes total sense given the circumstances of thunderstorm just the previous day. We got our flights rebooked for Saturday (Dec 24, 2022). The rebooked flight had stopover at Chicago (MDW) before reaching to DAL. Right before boarding the flight at LGA, the gate agent informed us about the cancelled flight from MDW to DAL. Since, we did not have a place to stay in MDW, we cancelled the whole trip and informed the gate agent about our decision. However, our bags got checked in and could not be taken out from the flight. For the next two days - Sunday and Monday I have been going to the airport and standing in line for 4-6 hrs on each day because no one responds to the phone. My wife has been on phone to get hold of an agent for almost 4 hrs everyday but in vain. Following are the major issues with Southwest: 1. In the name of winter storm there are coming with lame excuses. There is impact of storm from Wednesday till Friday. Every major airline except Southwest recovered from it and resumed their operations. However, Southwest has major operational meltdown everywhere. This is fact ! 2. You lift the damn phone and answer the customers. You are causing agony and anxiety by ripping apart our once in a year holiday break. 3.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I had my flight scheduled for Christmas Day - looked at the app before heading to the airport, all was well. It wasn't until after dropping off my bags and getting through security did I notice an overwhelming number of people at each gates. Doubled - checked the monitor to see if there were any changes, and there was. About a 45 minute delay to my Midway connection before heading to Minneapolis-St. Paul. Maybe 20 minutes later I checked the app and it said the connection was cancelled. I did not receive a text notification that it was cancelled. Talk about lack of visibility. Tried making it easier on the airline by rebooking my own flight through the app, didn't work, tried the website, also didn't work. Kept receiving an error code. Mind you, I have no luggage on me (I checked all of it). Then, I wait 1.5 hours in the guest services line, while trying to reach their phone line to be instructed that I could've been rebooked on another flight but it ""just had left""... so it was a time and place thing which could've been solved if the app or website was working, or even if I had received a notification earlier in the day. They then rebooked me for another flight for the 26th that was then cancelled at 6:30am this morning. I swear it was a ghost flight to hold people over to be disappointed another day later. It's 11:33AM and I waited on the phone for 2.5 hours to be disconnected. My luggage is in an unknown location, and I am utterly frustrated and sad.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I do the majority of the travel for 16 people. I, and my family are extremely upset with SW. This past year with all the canceled and delayed flights, it has been a nightmare. Most all of these flights were DAL - MCO and RT on non- stops. But we pushed through hoping it would get better, trying to understand. Birthday flights to Orlando, disastereous with seriously delayed flights. For 7 of our party. Costing us empty non refundable hotel rooms, theme park tickets and the stress of all of us not being togther for my birthday. Canceled flight for 3 trying to get to HHN at Universal Studious. Tickets bought and and a hotel room unused and non refundable. These two stick out but the worst of all, is our Christmas flights. My husband and I were set to fly to MCO on a non stop and Christmas eve as we try to check in to find I get a seat and he does not. SW split us up, and put my husband on standby with 15 people in front of him. To make matters worse, just hours before we have to drive an hour & a half to DAL cant get anyone on the Phone. We were left on eternal hold, hung up on 4 times and upon calling back received several busy signals. The bottom line, SW ruined our Christmas. Again we had non refundable hotels stays. And the memories we missed are priceless to us. AND this morning, they canceled our minor childs flight on a non stop from ATL - DAL. She was supposed to be home today but now she can't get home until Thursday. I don't need excuses about the weather. There is no weather in the south. If there is a problem where ever to Dal, pull out a plane from the hanger DAL, it is their hub. Stop over booking, Your airline has cost me $2100 in unused, non refundable rooms, $1200 in unused park tickets, and stress for our family ALL year. We missed out on happy memories to be replaced with anger and frustration. We will be closing all our SW Rapid rewards accounts, and our Chase SW Credit cards. They are no longer reliable.

Not Verified |  I have flown faithfully with Southwest for many years and I’ve never had to cancel a flight. But my boyfriend was ill and didn’t want to expose anyone to whatever he had so we choose to cancel. When we bought our tickets it said in bold print no cancellation fee. And I looked at the small print papers and they also said no cancellation fee will be incurred. When I called to cancel the first person said there is a 200.00 dollar cancellation fee. I asked to speak to a higher person and they told me I have no choice to accept fee or lose all the money. At first I accepted it . Then I read their policy over and over and again it said no cancellation fees. I called back and spoke to someone and said this is not acceptable your policy clearly states no cancellation fees. I had to fight with this person and I told them I will see them in court and call news crews. They finally gave me back my 200.00 dollars. I still have the policy and no fees incurred on my phone. I’m disappointed that they know their policy but yet try to lie and and steal money from their clients. My boyfriend is a lawyer and I’m an educated women and had to fight for my rights. How many people have paid the fee that shouldn’t have. The airline clearly are stealing from people. The public needs to be aware of these deceptive practices. I’m sure they know what they are doing.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I liked Southwest. We booked the trip during one of their low-fare specials. We didn't experience any delays or boarding issues at all. In fact, we had a total of 4 flights (to and from our destination) and we landed about 20 minutes early for all of them. Flight attendants and gate attendants were friendly. Even the staff at the bag drop was friendly. I really think you receive the ""energy"" you give to people. So I greeted them with a smile and they returned with great customer service. The only thing I will say is that since there aren't different boarding classes, it can be a cramped ride. Two of our flights were booked to capacity, which means there wasn't any extra space or stretching room for your arms or legs. It can be uncomfortable. Still, the inflight movies & snacks helped to ease the ""cramped space"" blues. I would recommend Early-bird check-in to try to get A or B-section boarding--to accommodate your carry-on and seat preference. Some of the travelers in the C section had to check their carry-on luggage at the last minute because the A & B sections used all of the overhead bins. The airlines have a lot of no-hassle policies which I like: 2 free checked bags Free movies & live TV Decent fares Free cancellation and changes I probably wouldn't use the airlines for flights over 2 hours, just because of the seating tightness.

This is the worst airline service in The United States by long stretch. This airline has managed to make what should be simple, into a complicated mess with their seating program. If you have to be somewhere on time or if you have to be at an event that is time dependent, do not fly this airline. You will be late and there will be multiple delays or delays then a cancellation following right after. This airline doesn’t cancel early ever, if they cancel a flight, it’s last minute when they calculate it isn’t worth a flight. They do not care if you depended on them, this airline will bend you over with no remorse or second thoughts. This is the airline that will get you to places, but that could mean between 1-3 days after your scheduled flight because of delays and cancellations at the last minute due to not selling enough tickets, but this is how this business conducts its service.

"✅ Trip Verified |  San Diego: Jam packed terminal, absolutely no seating for the entire day. I stood for hours. Multiple delays and two flight re-bookings from 10:55 AM until 6:10 PM in San Diego, when I finally boarded the last flight out of San Diego to Chicago trying to get to Washington DC. I was assured by the gate agent that I would make my connection from Chicago to DC. I missed it by 30 minutes. Arrived at MDW in the middle of the night. No open restaurants in the airport. Took shuttle to expensive hotel, not in my budget, to say the least. No room service. Closed for the night.  No meal vouchers, no compensation offered. Spent $175 for a 5 hour stay. Southwest claimed weather related issues, but other airlines were taking off from San Diego in the fog! Why not Southwest? The truth is, I overheard personnel (flight attendants, gate agents) discussing missing co-workers.  Saying that the delays were weather related let them off the hook for any compensations to abandoned passengers. Flight four of four: Jam packed terminal in Houston, waiting for flight to San Diego. Screaming 3 yr old, screaming 1 year old (same family) in terminal, waiting for our flight. The family (three women) held these screaming children on their laps in the terminal for an hour, never letting them down to walk or run. Then, on the airplane, they sat in the seats behind me. I was in the bulkhead seat, along-side a handicapped man. For the duration of the three hour flight, the young, inexperienced mother did nothing to quiet her children while she read a book.. She gave them no toys, did not talk to them, just let them kick the seats in front of them non-stop, squirt juice onto the head of the handicapped man, all the while letting out non-stop ear-piercing, blood-curdling screams. I have travelled with toddlers before, many times. I know it can be difficult, but this was a parenting issue. The flight attendant was just a few feet away, so could not miss what was going on. The handicapped man asked the flight attendant to intervene multiple times. Only twice, she spoke gently to the mother, who responded ""They are children! What am I supposed to do?"" She was completely unapologetic. The flight attendant never spoke in a firm manner with her, as she should have. I can't help but think that if the screaming kicking person were an adult, the plane would have been landed at the nearest airport and an arrest would have occurred with head -spinning speed. Why is such torture of other passengers tolerated? There was a lot that could have been done to alleviate the situation. Do children's rights trump adult's rights? One of those screaming children did not even pay for a seat, as we adults did. My seat-mate and I agreed that, even though we have both been die-hard Southwest customers for decades (I am 68, and I have been flying on you since you were a baby airline!), we said to each other that we would never again willingly fly Southwest.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Santa Ana to Portland via San Jose. Our group of 3 persons paid the add on fee of Early Bird for our round trip. Our trip down went as booked. However, Sept 30 we did our online check in (22 hours ahead) and had been assigned A24-25-26 early bird boarding for both legs of our returning flights. Yesterday— Oct 1, 2022 we got to the airport to check in only to find out we had been reassigned to C group on first leg and B group on 2nd leg. At this point we still had NO IDEA our entire itinerary had been changed. I paid an additional $30 fee to upgrade to A7 boarding the other 2 in my group kept their C group. We were all confused and angry. We got down to the gate only to realize we were not even on flight 376 anymore but we were now on a flight 282 to San Jose and our SJC to PDX was also different. So we were no longer on our 4:10pm flight out of Santa Ana to San Jose. We had been moved to a 6:45pm flight because we found out our Portland connection flight had been cancelled. So because they had changed our itinerary at 9am on 10/1 we no longer had A group early bird boarding assigned. We were now stuck in C boarding which was why I had been told I had to pay another $30 upgrade fee so that I would still be in A group. The agent checking us in never even realized what had happened to us. She was very nice but her explanations to us were NOT accurate. She never even told us we were no longer on our 4:10 pm flight. As far as I’m concerned —ALL of this was horrible SW airlines service. We were never consulted on any changes or choices that were made for us. When we did our initial online check in we were in A group for our original reservation flights. When they changed us they did not give us our PrePaid early bird check ins for those new flights. In addition, in reality they should never have changed our first flight either because we could have just had an extended layover of 2 hours in San Jose but still had our pre assigned A group for that portion. I am unhappy and VERY dissatisfied. If they are moving flights they need to be sure they can still honor their own early bird boarding on the flights they are moving their customers to. I am giving them a very low rating because they did not honor the early bird options that our group of 3 had chosen when we made our original reservations and also PAID for. In addition I’m giving the ticket agent a 3 rating because while she was a very nice woman — she should have been able to figure out and tell us that all these changes had been made!!

When we were close to the departure time, I reached out to the desk to inquire when the boarding would begin. Thats when the LCD showed 'boarding closed' status.

We traveled to Iowa for a wedding, my bag had my clothes as well as clothes for my 2 year old daughters (who was a flower girl in the wedding). Upon arrival with no bag, the nice gal at the Southwest counter said it will be here late tonight, and to call before coming in case the flight was delayed. I called at 4am the following morning (as that’s when she said was the next opening of the office) and my bag hadn’t moved from my original departure location. I called 4 more times that day, to be told different stories each time about how they would get my back to DesMoines, or that is was just sitting and they couldn’t tell what was going on until the bag was scanned in again. It almost seemed like once the bag is lost, there isn’t really a person who ensures it gets back on a flight to the final destination. The agents could only tell me where it was sitting. No bag delivered Saturday night. Bag finally delivered Sunday morning. Upon arrival, the nice gal at the counter gave me my bag and told my to come by after 1pm and they will have a check ready. She even scanned in my receipts. Came by after 1pm and she explained to me that I had to email the Southwest Manager at the DesMoines airport for details on how to submit the claim.  I just spend the better part of $800 and now you explain to me that I have to submit a claim and wait 30-45 days. I would not be upset if she informed me of the correct process on the front end.

"✅ Trip Verified |  My grandson and I were supposed to leave Juan Santamaria Airport in San Jose, Costa Rica en route to Baltimore at 1:05 p.m. on Saturday, August 13. The flight had six delays and did not depart until after 7:00 p.m. The passengers were told that the scheduled pilot had flown too many hours within some specified time, and was over FAA regulations. Another pilot needed to be found. In addition, they said there were ""some problems in Baltimore"" without specifying what. I will note there are a lot of problems in Baltimore. It seems completely irresponsible to me that an airline would not keep track of pilot hours flown in order to avoid putting their customer through the situation we experienced. Before we boarded we were informed that our flight would not be non-stop, which is what we paid for. The reason given was that be the time we reached Baltimore the customs agents would have quit work for the day. We were rerouted through Houston, which added another two hours to our total flying time. When we arrived in Houston we had to drag our carry-ons out of the plane at 11:00 p.m. to have them clear customs--over three hours after we were to have landed in Baltimore--then lug them back onto the plane. Our flight finally touched down in Baltimore around 4:00 a.m., over eight hours later than the scheduled 7:45 p.m. arrival of the previous day. At least my grandson and I could go home. Many travelers were transferring in Baltimore to other destinations. For them, the agony of the day only continued. I will add that our check-in to go to Costa Rica on Saturday, August 6 did not go well either. The line at the international check-in was over one-eighth of a mile long! I have photos to prove it. Southwest did not have sufficient agents to accommodate the customers on the international flights they had booked. They were grossly understaffed. It was only through the intercession of an agent that my grandson and I were able to make our departing flight. Southwest offered the passengers on our returning flight a $200 coupon good for another Southwest flight within the next year. Big deal! We paid $1,000 round trip, $500 each way. If they really wanted to make amends they would have had a rebate commensurate with the frustration they heaped upon their customers. When Southwest arrived on the national scene years ago as a regional airline which was expanding I was very impressed. They can blame their current problems encountered by me, my grandson, and all the other customers on COVID, not enough employees, supply-chain issues, or whatever other excuses are in vogue these days. It is clear to me that this company has devolved to a significant degree. They have lost the customer-orientation they once had. Not being able to add the hours a pilot flies, and not being able to compute how many check-in people are needed for the departing flights are issues of poor management. Very poor! I will be looking for other carriers for my future trips to Costa Rica, and suggest to all who read this not to fly Southwest until such time that they give evidence of better management ... like being able to add and divide.

"Not Verified |  I appreciate almost everything about Southwest Airlines: their friendly staff members, their free check bags, and even their customer service agents. But what really brings my review in today is a frustration that really ruined the experience altogether. After an anticipated flight home they texted to report that they had canceled our flight, with very short notice. They then rebooked us for another flight with 7+ hrs of airtime. Traveling with an infant makes that possibility near disaster. When I tried to call and rebook (the customer service gal was very courteous, but there wasn’t much she could do) every other flight was significantly longer in airtime or wasn’t until weeks out (since all the more direct flights had been sold out probably months ago). I would like Southwest to consider how this effects the people of whom they claim to care for. The short notice on cancelation left us no choice but to bite the bullet and pay a more expensive ticket on another airline (since its booking a day before) or waste time that could have been spent with the family we were hoping to see and take the longer more miserable travel route. I’m not sure on the reason for the cancelation but a promise/commitment to provide a service should mean something, especially when you pay for it! It would be nice if they would follow through. Regardless of the fact that they may lose a little money by flying a plane that doesn’t get sold out. If the cancelation was for other reasons not related to business or money, I may understand.

She would have to spend a night in Baltimore rather than flying on to Minneapolis as scheduled. The SW agent directed her to work it out with another airline, but a Delta supervisor explained that Southwest doesn't participate in a reciprocal arrangement with any other airline. My daughter was forced to buy a Delta ticket at double the cost of the original Southwest flight in order to get home the same day. I meanwhile ran back to the SW counter to get a refund.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Our flight was delayed about 3 hours and we didn’t leave Orlando until after 1am… not the end of the world but there were no representatives giving us any updates on the status of our flight but just a gate monitor showing our flight getting more and more delayed which was kind of frustrating. It would have been nice to see better communication from Southwest employees so I knew why the plane was delayed and if I should expect it to be cancelled or not. At one point during my long wait at the gate, they started boarding another flight that wasn’t supposed to leave until 2 hours after ours so that was frustrating as well. I just felt like my flight was forgotten about until 1am. On the bright side, I got into the A boarding group without paying extra for reserved check-in despite it being a full flight. The crew was very nice, the seats were fairly comfortable, and I got a variety of free snacks as well as a free drink. Entertainment was available on the Southwest app and WiFi was available for purchase. If it weren’t for the lack of communication and delay, I would give Southwest 10/10.

"Not Verified | Atlanta to La Guardia. On Monday, July 25th, 2022, my daughter and I were returning home from Atlanta to NYC (LaGuardia) via Southwest Airlines. First time ever using them. We arrive at the airport at 4AM for a 6:10AM flight. After going through TSA and sitting at the gate for a while, our flight was cancelled with no announcement or warning. My daughter happened to look up and see on the gate TV screen the words “CANCELLED”. The gate personnel were gone and I was left to 1) calm my daughter’s nerves because she has never experienced this before 2) calm my own nerves as I suffered from severe anxiety and my meds were in my checked bag and 3) try to figure out what to do next. Keep in mind, I booked the early morning flight because I had to be home by 9:30am to take over the babysitting duties of my two other children so that my wife could go to work. So that was my first thing to address, finding last minute child care. I then get an email confirming that my flight was indeed cancelled (no explanation as to why) and I was put on the 8:25 PM plane to LGA later that night. So now the next steps were to find out what happened to our checked bags and what to do for 14 hours till my flight with pretty much no money left for my daughter and I to find a hotel (I mean we’re taking a low budget airline. I’m a stay-at-home dad living on my wife’s income. Go figure). 14 hours later with our bags in NY before we are even on a plane, we get to the departing gate for our rescheduled 8:25pm flight and of course it’s DELAYED. 9:10pm is the new departure time. Then it’s pushed back to 10PM!!! Once on the plane, only water and a snack was offered to us (soda, coffee and alcohol were no longer an option). Once at LaGuardia, we then had to find our checked bags. My pre-arranged airport pick-up, no longer available. The line for a taxi, extremely long. My daughter and I jumped on a city bus to take us to Manhattan so that we could take a taxi to the Bronx. $30 dollars I couldn’t afford to spend charged to my credit card. Long story short, got to the airport at 4AM and after an anxiety inducing day/afternoon, my daughter and I get home at 2am in the morning. Fast forward to today. I call Southwest customer service to 1) get an explanation and 2) find out how Southwest can make things right for me so that I can continue using them in the future (again, this was my first ever experience with them). The agent informed me that the first flight was canceled due to weather and that the rescheduled flight was delayed due to air traffic control issues, so we were not entitled to compensation. 1) I never once said on the call I wanted to be compensated so that was quite an assumption and 2) was then told after reiterating everything I went through “would you have preferred that we put you on an unsafe flight?” I mean WOW!!!!! What a “great” condescending customer service response. To the Southwest rep that hopefully reads this (and yes, I will be posting this on MULTIPLE review sites and social media), I shall NEVER fly Southwest again and will voice my displeasure to anyone who asks me about my experience with Southwest. PS- My family and I had an issue with JetBlue a few years ago and their customer service was the TOTAL OPPOSITE of what I experienced with Southwest.

A few minutes later, they arranged the passengers to either call or wait in line to the customer counter to have flight rearrange. The reason that was given the flight was cancelled is that weather in Orlando is bad enough for they now allowing flights to come in (which is a super stupid and big lie).

"✅ Trip Verified |  I’m currently sitting in the Houston Hobby airport fighting back tears of anger and frustration. Southwest should be ashamed of themselves but they are not. We landed from Harlingen at 9:04pm getting alerts that our flight home to St. Louis was delayed the minute airplane mode went off. Currently our flight home is a play pretend flight; as of this very moment the departure is scheduled for 2:19am and originally that departure was 9:55pm. We have no real scheduled flight home because the departure time is constantly being moved, the excuse is MCO weather bc that is the connecting flight however the gate next to ours is on time and flying into MCO, Southwest has no responsibility in the matter or to make anything right bc it’s “the weather’s fault”? I’m so disappointed. I exclusively fly Southwest. Say nice things (until now). Encourage and book trips that make y’all a lot of money.

"Not Verified |  As my departure time neared, I received several messages over the course of 2 hours. Each indicating an additional delay. This now meant I had no hope of making my connecting flight. I called to reschedule for the next possible flights to my destination. After waiting a half hour on hold, I explained my situation to a human, and was asked to be put on hold while he found me another flight. As I had already looked up possible flight schedules, I thought this would be a quick hold, as there were very few possibilities. After 40 minutes on hold, I was hung up on. Now, I have to call back. This time it only took 15 minutes to get a human, so I should consider myself lucky, right? I explained everything over again, and apologized if I sounded irate (which I was). This time, I just told the woman which flight I wanted. I then inquired about what she could do to make me feel better about flying Southwest, ever again in the future. I suggested a simple upgrade to 'A' on my boarding pass, to get me on the plane earlier, so I might get a window seat. This would have cost the airline nothing, and would have made me feel like they were actually sorry about my being quite inconvenienced. She said she couldn't do that, but could give me a discount on my next flight (which would cost them). I told her I didn't want a coupon for a flight I might never take, and she asked if I'd like to speak to someone about it. I said that I would like to speak with a supervisor, and was about to insist on not being put on hold, when...I was put on hold. I'm not one to give up easily, so I waited on hold... for an hour and a half, before I was forced to hang up because I had to leave home for my new flight at 3am, and it was almost 11pm.

Southwest took $7,500, ship our luggage to 2 different states, cancelling our flight without proper notice and called the Sherriff department to follow my family around the terminal to give us a ticket that we currently have to see a judge about now to clear our name. On top of paying $7,650.76, Southwest ask me to pay more money for my twins when I had originally paid for them to board the plane. Southwest never gave my family an apology for all of the strife, chaos, shaming, belittlement that’s that my have put on my family.  I will never have my family to board Southwest ever again.

"✅ Trip Verified |  So after 3 years, I decided to fly on SW airlines again. I've always had an amazing experience with this airline. They delayed my flight 10 minutes before boarding for 3 hrs. (It said on time even when the plane landed and was at the gate). They said it was the air traffic control in MCO. I checked the flight delays on all airlines. There were only 2 (that were non SWA, SWA had tons). Even frontier and spirit had none. AA was flying nonstop with no cancelations.  I then was cancelled and put on standby. I stood at the airport all night until all planes were exhausted (along with other families that had been there way longer than I had). I never got on a plane. In the mean time, I booked a ticket on AA. I asked for a hotel/motel voucher (they laughed). So I took a ride to DFW from Dallas love with a trip booked in the morning. I had to pay for the motel room. I never cancelled my flight. My thought was maybe I'm wrong. The data is lying to me. Yet, I was right. I got on that flight with AA with no problem. I monitored my standby/alternate ticket situation with SW the entire time in air and off. It kept getting pushed back over and over again. To the point that it was landing 3 days from the point I booked. I canceled. I'd love to give my credit to someone needing a flight, but I cannot. I'm the only one it works for.  Never again will I book this airline! They are worse than Spirit or Frontier. BTW, My AA ticket coming back was not delayed or canceled either.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Deplorable customer service! They deserve a negative star. I flew from Syracuse to Charlotte 4/24 when I get my stroller bag I noticed it was partially unzipped, when I go to get the stroller out I see both wheels are broken off and placed under the stroller. The top bassinet/carrier part was also disconnected, which was connected when I checked it in and zipped it up. I know my stroller was intentionally dismantled to make it fit smoother under the plane. I went to the ticket counter where Diane and a manager both told me they do not cover damages only losses. They filled out a report and said I can try to talk to customer service to see if they will replace it. I was sent home with no replacement and no check to replace my infant's stroller. Quickly forward to 5/1, I flew from St. Louis back to Charlotte again, only to have my car seat that I checked in not put on the plane! Once again Diane was at the ticket counter and gave me a loaner car seat. However, my car seat was also in a travel bag that needed to be replaced. Diane brought out the replacement car seat in a travel bag, but refused to loan it to me. I asked to speak to the manager and advised her when Southwest delivers my car seat and travel bag I will give them both (car seat and car seat bag) of theirs back. We stood there for about 30 minutes going back and forth. 20 minutes in she ask me to verify my name as if I had just walked up like Diane didn't already do it. Diane had already got my ticket and verified who I was (which is how I got the loaner car set from the beginning of the ordeal). Security was called, the manager said she couldn't believe I was acting like this and refused to give me the name of her regional manager. When I asked for her to write down her supervisor's name she refused and said you can take it down yourself. She started talking through her teeth at me like I was a child and threatened to walk away if I recorded her. If your acting professionally you wouldn't care if someone recorded you.

"Not Verified |  This is about customer service. We created a credit card with Southwest last year. They had two sets of nonstop flights to Virginia, which made it easy to travel to see my parents, which was important because we have two small children. A 5-hour flight with a layover has turned into a 12-hour flight due to delays, which isn't easy with small children. Imagine an unplanned 5 hours in the Dulles Airport. Well, these flights were in place throughout COVID, and were full, always. As soon as COVID started to lift, these flights disappeared. Gone. Now, we have at least one stop and more frequently, 2 stops to get to our destination. The same is true for my husband's family in New York. Southwest used to fly direct, and they dropped the direct flights. Today, I was on the phone trying to apply travel vouchers. I was under the impression that I needed to book travel within the expiration timeframe, not complete travel within the expiration timeframe. I have work travel that happens less than a week after the expiration date, and together with this misunderstanding, I thought maybe Southwest would help me out. No such luck; told me it's my problem. Obviously, it is my problem, but I hoped that an airline whose hold message (which I listened to for 20 minutes while my customer service agent took other calls instead of helping me) repeatedly talks about how much they care about customers, might have some flexibility in such a short timeframe. Other businesses help people out to maintain positive customer relations; too bad Southwest has turned a corner and is no longer actually serving the customer.

They were not pleasant when coming around for drinks or trash. They acted like they had a chip on their shoulder about something. Normally SW attendants have great personalities and offer decent humor on the flight but you got none of that with this gang. The only time they were nice was when announcing their “we know you have a lot of choices and we thank you for choosing SW” spiel at the end of the flight.

"Not Verified |  I booked my hotel like I always do through Southwest to get points. I was to earn 10,000 points for my stay via the Southwest concierge. Usually my points hot within 4 days after travel is complete. My flight hit and my car rental hit. I was waiting to book a trip for my wife and I to Austin to celebrate a friends redo of their 50th birthday. Points still have not hit after 3 weeks and now I believe they are taking their time out of spite. Now they are telling me they have to wait for hotel to notify on how many points they need to apply to my account. This is complete rubbish, because it tells you how many points when you book and when you get confirmation email from Southwest.

Not Verified |  Shame on Southwest Airlines. My husband and I and our family have used Southwest for over 20 years. This past March 12 we were supposed to leave Portland Maine at 5:30 in the morning and we received a cancellation for no reason on March 11 at 11 PM in the evening. We could not get through to the site via Internet or phone on how to reschedule a new flight. Since we had reservations for two weeks in Orlando all paid for we needed to get on a flight as soon as possible. So my husband tried and tried and waited on hold for almost an hour before he finally just gave up and decided to book a different flight and the only one we could fly find was from Boston which is a 2 Hour Drive instead of a 15 min drive to Portland. The only flight we could find was for 530 leaving Boston that morning which meant we had to leave Portland Maine by 2 AM. We did not sleep at all that night. On top of that the flight that was connecting was delayed as well. The real kicker is that because we did not follow Southwest Airlines rules for rescheduling a canceled flight we had to pay $700 more to drive two hours longer to get to the airport to actually get on a flight. And the person who answered our phone call later on was like oh well too bad you didn’t do it the way you were supposed to. I just don’t understand how a an airline can cancel the flight out of the blue for no reason and not assist their travelers. and then along the way the attendants were rude and obnoxious and in no way helpful or kind. We are still trying to figure out how we can get refunded our money over something that we did not do we did not cancel the flight Southwest airlines canceled the flight. They should honor the fact that we had booked our flights months ahead of time. And they should do a better job when canceling a flight to assist customers and getting to where they need to be.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Raleigh to Hartford via Baltimore,March 2022,yes,shame on southwest airlines my husband and i and our family have used southwest for over 20 years this past march 12 we were supposed to leave portland maine at 530 in the morning and we received a cancellation for no reason on march 11 at 11 pm in the evening we could not get through to the site via internet or phone on how to reschedule a new flight since we had reservations for two weeks in orlando all paid for we needed to get on a flight as soon as possible so my husband tried and tried and waited on hold for almost an hour before he finally just gave up and decided to book a different flight and the only one we could fly find was from boston which is a 2 hour drive instead of a 15 min drive to portland the only flight we could find was for 530 leaving boston that morning which meant we had to leave portland maine by 2 am we did not sleep at all that night on top of that the flight that was connecting was delayed as well the real kicker is that because we did not follow southwest airlines rules for rescheduling a canceled flight we had to pay 700 more to drive two hours longer to get to the airport to actually get on a flight and the person who answered our phone call later on was like oh well too bad you didnt do it the way you were supposed to i just dont understand how a an airline can cancel the flight out of the blue for no reason and not assist their travelers and then along the way the attendants were rude and obnoxious and in no way helpful or kind we are still trying to figure out how we can get refunded our money over something that we did not do we did not cancel the flight southwest airlines canceled the flight they should honor the fact that we had booked our flights months ahead of time and they should do a better job when canceling a flight to assist customers and getting to where they need to be,shame southwest airlines husband family used southwest 20 years past march 12 supposed leave portland maine 530 morning received cancellation reason march 11 11 pm evening could get site via internet phone reschedule new flight since reservations two weeks orlando paid needed get flight soon possible husband tried tried waited hold almost hour finally gave decided book different flight one could fly find boston 2 hour drive instead 15 min drive portland flight could find 530 leaving boston morning meant leave portland maine 2 sleep night top flight connecting delayed well real kicker follow southwest airlines rules rescheduling canceled flight pay 700 drive two hours longer get airport actually get flight person answered phone call later like oh well bad didnt way supposed dont understand airline cancel flight blue reason assist travelers along way attendants rude obnoxious way helpful kind still trying figure get refunded money something cancel flight southwest airlines canceled flight honor fact booked flights months ahead time better job canceling flight assist customers getting need,NEG

"Not Verified |  My husband had been an A-List member of Southwest Airlines for over 20 years. He traveled extensively for his work and we always appreciated the special perk he received of priority boarding due to his status. When Covid hit and all airlines came to a halt, his company put a moratorium on all travel - even after the airlines were back up and running. Last fall he received a promotion from Southwest that if he traveled one round trip flight anywhere, he could retain his A-List status. Unfortunately, he had been diagnosed with cancer back in the spring of 2021 and began undergoing cyberknife treatments in September 2021. His doctors specifically told him he should not travel through the remainder of the year as he was immunocompromised. We contacted Southwest and let them know the situation. The agent with whom I spoke advised that if we could provide a certification from his oncologist, they would consider our request to extend his status despite the fact he was unable to travel even the bare minimum in 2021. Yesterday, after going through a second appeal process following an initial denial of our request from Southwest, we were told they would not be able to honor our request. I am absolutely appalled that this airline, which our entire family has supported religiously for the past 20 years (in addition to all of my husband's business travel), would not consider these extenuating circumstances and grant him an exception. Shame on you Southwest for not having more heart. Perhaps if someone in a leadership role is faced with the same daunting cancer diagnosis and finds themselves undergoing this brutal treatment, they'll reconsider this ridiculous policy.

"Not Verified |  My review is for the Southwest staff at the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport. It wasn’t crowded. There were no long lines. And yet every desk employee was rude, grumpy, non-smiling, and abrupt. My questions were met with sour looks, wrong information (it turned out), and I have MS and although I don’t appear disabled, I walk with great difficulty. My husband was with me. We needed a wheelchair. There were no pushers at all and we were treated like it was too much to ask or expect. We weren’t blaming Southwest about the wheelchairs but that is who we had to ask for it. But that wasn’t a main issue. The desk agents in arranging our new flights treated us like scum under his feet, he made mistakes, instead of answering our questions he said “You’re done so move away.” My husband was trying to push my wheelchair, I was rolling my carry on beside me, my tote on my lap, my husbands back pack We had been stuck in Phoenix 2 nights due to weather. We were smiling, respectful, polite and understanding…on purpose. It didn’t help. He again told us to get out of the way quickly. In 2 days, back at the airport, after our new flight didn’t show on the APP, waiting on hold 3 hours, never receiving the previously requested call back, Finally we got an email with the flight confirmation. The desk agent had no one else in line, and couldn’t find us in the computer. My husband looked up the email with the confirmation to show her and she rudely said ”I don’t want to see any phones. Don’t show me papers (we hadn’t). You aren’t booked.” We were but somehow she couldn’t find us until she tried for over 10 minutes. Not sure if it was system or human problem. Ok so no wheelchair pushers on duty so that was a wreck. I’m pushing 2 carryons beside my wheelchair, husband is carrying 2 items plus pushing. We get to security. No help at all. An agent said we needed a pusher and to go to the information desk and ask them to call for a pusher through security. The info man said ”I don’t know who told you that but I don’t do that.” So security was a mess. I can’t walk or stand long enough. I needed to stay in my chair. I was greeted with sour looks and impatience. when they asked if I could try to walk through the scanner. I can’t. And I can’t help my disease.  I waited a long time before a woman security person came to get me through. I didn’t mind waiting. I did mind being spoken to in such a rude manner. Because we had to check out of the hotel 6 hours before our flight, we had several hours to wait at the airport and gate. And the list of rude Southwest staff went on.

"✅ Trip Verified | Great price for airfares, but you pay for it with their customer service. They are lazy, do not take time to help their customers, and are selfish with their time. I was recently in Dallas airport and called the desk because their agent had made a mistake with my ticket. I accidentally left my AirPods at the desk. I boarded my plane and noticed they were missing. I quickly checked the location and called the desk. I explained I was already on the plane, so that I couldn’t get off. We had about 75 people still boarding, and the door was still open. The agent at the desk, said if I have time, I will walk them to your gate.

"Not Verified |  Within my four flights (to and from NM) there has been a total of 8 hours worth of delays/waiting. Our first flight we were going to NM from Maine, and, due to a technical error, my name was misspelled and it took staff a very long time both times to fix the name on the boarding pass (but I don’t blame the staff, I blame the system that Southwest uses). We were already there two hours early so we had time to do the things we needed to do before boarding, but Southwest Airlines will be giving you so much time that you won’t know what to do with yourself. We were told that the very first delay was due to the plane being “too heavy” because of passengers, baggage, and fuel. After they sorted that out, we were finally on our way. After we landed for our connecting flight in Baltimore, we waited an hour on the pavement to get to a terminal because all of them were full. Once we finally got to a terminal in Baltimore we had to haul butt to the other side of the Airport because our connecting flight was going to be missed (no thanks to Southwest). This being my first time flying, I decided not to let it bother me too much. However now that we are flying back, and dealing with the same extensive delays and terrible customer reimbursement of funds and services, I decided it might be time to give a cent. I’d like to note that all the staff have been so helpful and wonderful this whole time, the flight attendants and pilots have been extremely kind and apologetic for this airlines absurd behavior and policies. Right now, it’s 9:56pm in Baltimore and our flight was supposed to leave at 9:05pm. We were already delayed 30 minutes, and as soon as passengers started lining up to get on the delayed plane, someone on the intercom stated that suddenly the plane is unsafe to travel in, and therefore have cancelled that flight. They ended up keeping us in the dark for a while until we were told to move to Terminal B7 instead of B9. We’re awaiting the plane to leave that’s currently there so that a new plane can pull up. However I’m expecting at least an hour more of waiting because they will need to fuel, pack, and board the plane. Overall, I’ll give a 5 star rating to your very helpful, kind, and patient staff. I’ll give a 0 star rating to everything else. We were in the dark the whole time, and it was made very clear to us that if the airline messed up, it was on us. Southwest even over-boards the planes for profit with no guarantee of a seat. So if it’s overpacked and there isn’t a seat for you, someone is expected to voluntarily give up their seat. And if they don’t, I think they’ll try to find another plane for you but I’m not 100% sure - either way, what we’re they thinking? You don’t board a plane without plans?

"Not Verified | I flew to Denver on December 21, 2021, with a return flight scheduled for January 3, 2022. I got caught in the biggest, most devastating fire ever in Colorado's history. My family and I were evacuated. This was a very traumatic experience and I was exposed to Covid. I tried to schedule a Covid test before the day of my flight but the earliest I could get an appointment was January 3. I bore the expense to drive home out of respect for other passengers and my inability to test due to the chaos and tragic circumstances surrounding the Marshall Fire. I received the following response today: Dear Brenda, We are sorry to learn that you were unable to travel as planned due to not feeling well, and we hope you are doing well. The reservation in question was booked at our Wanna Get Away fare, which carry restrictions such as being nonrefundable. And, while we wish we could honor every request to refund a nonrefundable fare, the reason we are able to offer these fares at such a substantial discount in the first place is because they are a firm commitment to travel. In this situation, the originally-ticketed Passenger still has the flexibility to apply these travel funds to a new reservation provided the reservation is canceled at least 10 minutes prior to travel and travel is completed by the expiration date. We are hopeful you will be able to travel with us soon. We know you have a choice when you fly, and we hope you will continue to choose Southwest. We would truly appreciate the chance to welcome you onboard soon.  I canceled out of respect for other passengers. Incidentally, I did have Covid making for a miserable drive home.

"✅ Trip Verified | Due to weather my original flight was canceled and rebooked without my knowledge. Then there were multiple delays due to weather. Both I understood and accepted. However, with the chaos my concern now was with my luggage. And that concern was valid, now 5-days into a trip to visit my daughter I still have no clothes other than what I borrow from her. During this time they repeatedly gave me misinformation on where my luggage was and when it would arrive. At one point my luggage never left Texas but they assured me it was on a flight to Baltimore and and they'd call me when it arrived. Well at 6 I called and they said they were offloading it. Called back at 7 and they tell me it never left Texas. Not one time did they call me to tell me any of this or offer any type of apology for apparently lying. I called tonight to ask for the location of my luggage as it was due in today. Now 5-days in and my bag was delayed another day. The service representative tonight again lacked empathy to my situation and offered us a $100 voucher. In what world does a $100 voucher makeup for not having my luggage delivered to me for 6-days in the middle of winter.

"✅ Trip Verified | First, we stood in line for 1 hour and 15 minutes before we were able to even get to the counter flying Business Select then another 15 plus minutes to get checked in as the customer service rep looked all around instead of paying attention to what he was doing. It took 5 scans of each of our passports, 2 of us were traveling together. People were moving others to the front of the business line for tips. 1 counter working A List passengers that pay more for expedition to begin with, and we were solicited to tip more to get us to the front of the line. No way! Then we were given a free drink coupon for our flight. Beer, wine or liquor was valid for the day of travel only and only for Southwest Airline, this was rejected by attendant with ""We haven't had alcoholic beverages for over two years now, then he chuckled"". A non alcoholic beverage offering at that time would have been nice, but no offer. We had already had coffee and soda, so maybe one drink allowed. This is the worst experience ever flying. Why should I pay for business class if it does not benefit me. We boarded behind wheelchair passengers and their extended families who miraculously were able to travel walking when landed due to no wheelchairs available yet at the gate. Three of 9 remained seated waiting for assistance. I have no problem waiting for those three, at all. This makes me question if I will ever fly Southwest again, but I will never pay for Business Class again with them, regular boarding took well over 2 hours to check in for the flight. There were at least 5 counters to serve other class boarding. The security process took way less time as they screened everyone's bags and persons.

"✅ Trip Verified | My half brother who is intellectually challenged asked for help in obtaining his boarding pass this morning at the Orlando (MCO) terminal for Southwest Airlines. He was there at 5:00 am for a 6:45 am flight. He forgot his mask. A Customer Assistant lady told him that he had to get out of line and possibly was going to be thrown out of the airport because he did not have a mask. This is after he politely told them that he forgot his mask and if they could get him a mask. He had to go and purchase a mask. Luckily there was a kind soul in line that provided him with a mask to wear. Needless to say he was petrified that he would miss his flight. Like I instructed him to ask for help with the kiosk to obtain his boarding pass. I have never had any problems in the many years I've flown Southwest Airlines or other airlines in my Air Force career spanning decades. The staff member told him that he had to get his own boarding pass, he had to do manage the kiosk by himself.

"Not Verified |  I had the most terrible experience flying with Southwest for the first time. First, I had to deal with security at Baltimore airport, who shook me down over a bottle of hair cream and because of the sparkles on my sweater and missed my first flight, then I was placed on a later flight with Southwest, waiting to get back home to Florida, but waited an entire hour at the airport, due to the flight being delayed and the Southwest staff failing to update us on why we were an hour late leaving the airport. When an explanation was finally provided, we were told that our plane had to be towed, which made no sense, then we were told that we were unable to board, due to a technical issue with the computers. So, we were dealing with a huge, tired and confused group of people, waiting around in the airport, just waiting to go home. Oh and the saga doesn't end there, once we were FINALLY able to board the plane, we had to wait an additional 30 minutes, for no reason.

"Not Verified |  When Southwest Airlines first came out with the early bird special to purchase for early check-in, I thought it was a great idea. However, it sucks or is a scam. Seven times out of seven, I got in the worse boarding positions; only the very first time was I in ""A"" boarding category. My boarding positions were as follows (when I used the early bird check-in): A36, B15, B22, C1, B7, C10, B30. I will no longer purchase the early bird special. as it (clearly) does not check you in early for good boarding positions. Oh, as a side note, the last 3 check-ins I did without the early bird special, when I did it myself, my boarding positions were: A5, A8, A12. In case nobody knows, seat are not assigned, just boarding positions. So when they announce that they are boarding ""A"" passengers to board the plane, then A1-A36 passengers enter the plane first and get the pick of the seat, then B1-B36 and then C1-36.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience on an airplane ever. I had been flying Southwest loyally for over 10 years. Today we had a flight from Hartford to Baltimore get delayed. In Baltimore I had a connecting flight to Sarasota. I asked the gate attendant if we would be in jeopardy of missing our connection to Sarasota. She said no that flight was also delayed. We arrived in the A wing , ran frantically to the B wing to make our connection. Myself and over 10 other passengers found the door to board closed, plane still there and we were denied access to the plane. Without our knowledge, Southwest changed our flights to a later flight without ever notified us all. They refused to let all of us on the plane that was still sitting there. I paid extra to be in the A group for priority boarding, but my reissued ticket has us in the C group, last people to board. When asked the attendant said it would cost an additional $40. I already paid the $40 on my original ticket and I know from past experience that whenever I changed my reservation I never lost my A status. Because Southwest made the changes, that did not happen. I will never fly them again. Thank you Southwest for sticking a loyal customer in the back of the plane. You denied us all access to our original flight, delayed our original flight, changed our reservation without our notice and stuck us in the back of the plane. Keep your travel voucher Southwest. You mistreated many customers today. I will try your new competitor Avelo which is actually cheaper or Jet Blue from now on.

"Not Verified |  I have flown Southwest for several years but currently looking at other options. The service, dependability, and customer service of the past has dramatically changed and not for the better. I just returned yesterday on a flight from Texas. It is not possible as evidenced by passengers exiting the flight and the time at which passengers are then boarded for cleaning and sanitizing to be completed per their stated protocol. That, and the discarded wrappers in the seat pockets, as well as a sticky substance, splashed on the back of the seat in front of me further validates this. In addition, I have definitely had it with checking in at the very moment possible only to board and find passengers who've already boarded saving seats for others further back in the boarding process, while flight attendants who are very obviously aware do not enforce their own boarding practice. I am extremely weary of being treated like cattle. Most airlines have already eliminated the change fees, the only other perk that Southwest offers that others do not is 2 free checked bags, but even that is barely worth it anymore. I expect that other airlines will soon follow suit, and when that happens, it will be the end of Southwest if they do not improve their current practices. I applied for, and have received the chase sapphire card which will allow me to accrue points that can be used for any of the airlines.

"✅ Trip Verified | Southwest has quickly become the worst airline. My last two flights I have booked a non stop flight to Phoenix and both times they have switched my flights to having one or two stops. This particular time I received an email at 1am stating my flight has been canceled for no reason. My wife has been on the phone for more then 9 hrs trying to talk to a representative and still no one has answered. At this time news outlets has stated that due to weather and air traffic control was the issue, so I drive to the airport and asked myself. They stated is was due to staffing issues? Why wouldn't they know that at 9pm when I last checked the flight status? When I talked to the ticket agent I was greeted with condescending answers and a attitude. Thanks again Southwest! So they rescheduled my flight - I now leave Tuesday, I have lost 2 days of my vacation, my rental car, and my time from work.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I have liked flying Southwest until this trip. Our first suitcase came out open, yes unzipped along with many others where you could see the clothing inside, and ours was also cut in an 'L' shape. I left my husband and daughter while I went to file a claim. No one was in the baggage service area and when I went to enter to call out another SW employee told me not to enter. Showed this SW employee my issue and she told me to wait the lady would 'know' I was there. I asked how she would know as this person had not notified anyone, there was no doorbell or cameras. She replied the lady would just know. A psychic I guess. While waiting my daughter called hysterical as her lacrosse sticks had not come out with her teammates and the conveyor belt had stopped. When we found it that person was rude as well and stated all sticks come out at over-sized baggage and we should have known that. Guess they forgot to tell our team as all the rest of the lacrosse sticks in lacrosse stick bags like hers did and have never before or again come out in over-sized baggage. Hers was the only stick bag to come out at over-sized luggage and only that one time. When the baggage service lady finally showed up, the two SW employees had to converse first about how I was waiting and not happy, making me wait even longer. When she did finally come over she refused, not once, but several times to fill out a ticket on my issue. She said open and cut luggage was not a valid claim. She outright refused to do anything. It gets better folks, I called SW and was being on hold a very long time. Finally, someone gets on the phone listens to my issues and than proceeded to tell me the people were not SW employees, but employees of BWI and I had to make a claim with BWI. When I pointed out all the employees I was calling about all wore SW uniforms she proceeded to enter my complaint about their rude customer service, but told me I had to do my own for the luggage. I did per her instructions. SW responded to the rude complainant with a letter stating they were sorry I was inconvenienced with a delay in my flight and offered me a SW credit.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I trusted Southwest until a flight from Love Field to BWI September 16 2021 arriving 11:15 PM. Within five minutes of deplaning I realized I had left my phone on the plane. Unfortunately I had left the secure area so I could not return to Gate A 10 where the plane was located. I was directed by Southwest personnel to go to the baggage claim office to receive assistance. The three workers at baggage claim were admittedly dealing with a disgruntled employee and stated they could not help me at the time because they were ""too busy"". In fact the supervisor reprimanded me for leaving the phone on the plane and claimed it was my own fault for being so stupid. Despite resistance I insisted that a missing item claim be filed at the office before I departed the airport. I waited at baggage claim until 2:00 AM when an employee reportedly searched the plane only to find no cell phone. When I obtained access to my computer at 3:00 AM that morning I searched FIND MY PHONE, to discover my phone located at the Southwest baggage claim. I returned to the Southwest baggage claim the next morning and I showed them on my computer where my phone was located according to FIND MY PHONE. They told me they did not have my phone and that they could not help me. I then went to the police. They accompanied me to the SOUTHWEST baggage claim. He told me to stay outside the office and push my phone to ring on the FIND MY PHONE app, which I did. The police came out of the office and told me that my phone was in the office. When I went into the office to get my phone one employee verbally attacked me with comments such as ""you were the irresponsible one who lost your phone"" .

"Not Verified |  I have flown SW for over 10 years faithfully. This trip from Aruba on 9-5-21 was the worst flight attendants ever. None of them looked like they wanted to be at work yesterday. The plane wasn’t even full and they only offered drinks once on a four hour flight. I’m also amazed how many people get early boarding since most of the huge adults walked down the jet way without assistance. As someone who always pays extra to get a A seating assignment it’s not fair to us loyal customers. Do you even have documents from their MD with the reason they need to board before those who pay extra! They should have a MD excuse to get on early, these people were all in one group, knew everyone and traveled together. So can I use my BMI of 2 over normal as a reason to get on first in the front 5 rows? Or maybe my A1C level is slightly elevated or that I have to take Lipitor because my cholesterol is high. A passenger had to notify a flight attendant that someone sitting in an aisle seat wasn’t wearing his mask after she walked past him! Seriously?

"✅ Trip Verified |  My family and I had a flight booked for $949.90. The flight was scheduled to leave early Monday morning. We discovered it was cancelled around 3am Monday morning. We tried to schedule a different flight from Albany to Orlando but the next flight wasn’t until Wednesday, meaning we would miss 1/3rd of our prepaid Disney vacation. We called southwests customer service but there was a 2 hour wait. We ultimately booked a flight out of Hartford, CT to Orlando. This flight cost $2,844.90 nearly $2000 more than the initial flight. We had to have a family member drive us to Hartford to get the flight. While driving to Hartford we called the southwest customer service number back. I explained the situation and expected them to say they would quickly refund the $2,844.90. To my surprise the person told me I had two options. 1- she could only refund the $949.90 (the cost of the initial flight and I would have to pay the $2,844.90, meaning the vacation would cost me nearly $2000 more than I budgeted or 2- she could book the next flight from Albany to Orlando, two days later (causing my family to miss two days of our prepaid vacation). I asked if I could speak with a supervisor but she said she is a supervisor and she could not refund the $2,844.90. I told her I planned a vacation with my young family a long time ago and the plane having technical difficulties wasn’t my fault, and I had to have a family member take the day off work to drive me to Hartford. She said my only other option was to send a message to the customer service department which would be responded to within 10 days. I told her it was unacceptable, I have to spend time on my family vacation putting in the complaint and not knowing if I’m being charged an additional $2000!

"✅ Trip Verified |  Over the past year and half, my husband and I have flown many times on Southwest, and prior to the Covid pandemic, Southwest was always our airline of choice for domestic flights. The pandemic changed things, quite understandably, and we have had patience in what we know has been a difficult situation. However, the past several flights we have completed with Southwest have definitely taken turns for the worst in terms of customer service, with flights being rescheduled without notification to us, re-routing us to flights that are not non-stop (when our originally booked flights were nonstop), returning us to our home town in the middle of the night (when our originally-purchased itinerary arrived late afternoon), losing our luggage, etc. But this is finally the last straw. We will not be flying Southwest again. In June, my mother passed away. The memorial service is scheduled to take place on August 8th. In July, as soon as the memorial service dates were confirmed, we booked our flights back to Portland from Colorado for the memorial service. Twenty-four hours before our flight time, we checked in, as is the usual routine with Southwest. We were assigned seats. Some hours later, we received the usual emails with reminders for timeliness of arrival to the airport for our flight, mask requirements, etc. Now, less than 8 hours prior to our flight departure time, we checked our flight status to give my family final updates for our arrival time only to find that Southwest has canceled our flight. All other flights from Denver to Portland within the next 24 hours are listed by Southwest as ""Unavailable."" We called the ""Contact Us"" number for Southwest Airlines to try to figure out what we could do to rectify the situation. After sitting on hold for literally 2 hours (with what became an increasingly annoying message about how sorry Southwest was for the delay and that they would be ""right with us, as soon as possible""), we finally gave up and hung up. While sitting on hold, we found and booked a flight on a different airline, at last minute prices with luggage fees, etc. This behavior by Southwest Airlines is profoundly unprofessional and completely unacceptable. It breaches the contract Southwest Airlines entered into with us, as its passengers, of a service they were to provide (transportation from Colorado to Oregon), paid for in advance, with the express understanding that the service would, in fact, be provided. At the very least, timely notice of the inability to provide the service should have been provided, along with an explanation as to why the service was canceled at the last minute with literally no notice to us of the cancellation. No offer of restitution or alternative transportation has been made, and Southwest has refused to provide any sort of customer service (although I'm sure that no one could be paid enough to have to deal with customers treated in such a fashion by their employer). After going on line and reading recent Washington Post (among others) articles, we now see that Southwest has been doing this to its customers for the past several months. They certainly won't be doing it for very much longer, because they will be out of business soon. You cannot treat your customers like this and expect to continue to have any.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Pre-pandemic I was always flying Southwest with my family. I loved the free bags and no extra fees. I always had great customer service too. I used to recommend Southwest to everyone. Well let me tell you, no more! Their service, quality, and customer care has gone down the drain! I finally got to visit my family this summer after a year and a half of not seeing most of them due to the pandemic. Myself and my three boys traveled to our destination via American Airlines. Had no issues there - great service and a nice plane! On the way back, however, I traveled via Southwest. Unbeknownst to me they had changed my nonstop flight to a flight with one stop in Orlando. I found this out when checking on my flight a few days before. Now in their defense, I searched my email and they had notified me of this change back in the beginning of May via an email that I am fairly certain ended up in my promotions folder instead of my inbox or else I would have seen it. The thing that urked me is that they made this change the day after I bought my 3 nonstop tickets. The day after their sale ended, they decided to get rid of a bunch of nonstop flights. How convenient for them... Not so much all of us who booked with them because we wanted a nonstop flight. I was hoping they had one this week that I could change it to, but nope. Checked their website - none. Now mind you, I was traveling alone with three boys. My oldest is 6 and the other two are both under the age of 2 (a 21 month old and a 6 month old). If you are a parent, you understand how difficult this could be. I waited on hold for almost 2 hours just for them to tell me they could refund my tickets, but if I used flight credit it would stay as flight credit (not helpful as they have no nonstop flights on this route anymore). They said they ""temporarily"" got rid of nonstop flights from their schedule. I looked at my options for the week and either the layovers were way too short to make it to the other plane for us or they were long and required even more flight time. Needless to say, I had to keep my flight. By then other airlines were too expensive and Southwest said they could not book us on another airline. I was told this before I even asked so you know a bunch of people must have asked this. I haven't gotten to the worst part yet.. We had a fine first flight to Orlando. A little over two hours. They kept changing the time but ended up boarding on time after all. We made it to Orlando and our stroller was already waiting for us when we got off the plane. Kudos to Orlando people. Flying to Dallas was a different story. We were sitting in the plane an hour before we took off. This was due to the weather, so that, I understand. This was another 2 and a half hour flight as well. My poor kids were doing fairly well despite traveling all day. (Remember, two of them are a young toddler and a baby.) Near the end of the flight while we had been traveling for over 11 hours already one of the flight attendants remarks about the mess we had made (my toddler spilled some chip crumbs on the floor) and said that we would have to clean it up, but she said it in a passive aggressive way and asked if we needed.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Orlando via Denver,July 2021,no,    prepandemic i

"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew southwest 6 months pregnant with my husband, 11 year old son, and 2 year old daughter returning home to Orlando from Portland Oregon after coming from my mother passing away on 7/30/21. Our flight was scheduled to leave Portland at 2:00pm which was only delayed 30 minutes (no big deal). The lay over was in Denver we get off the plane with 30 minutes to spare before our connecting flight was suppose to take off to find out our flight had been canceled and was not leaving until 6:00am the next morning. We are then told to go wait in the customer service line for 45 minutes to get told we can’t have a partial refund, hotels would not be accommodated, and the flight in the morning would be taking us to Indianapolis then Orlando instead of our original flight which was straight from Denver to Orlando. The customer service representative cut me off and stated that they only had 4 spots on this plane so I needed to tell her if I wanted to be on the plane or not. They told us the flights were canceled due to weather but there was no bad weather in Denver or Orlando. My family and I went to the 3rd floor sat in seats and walked my 2 year old around in the stroller until she fell asleep for exactly 1 hour, no one else slept at all. We were able to leave at 5:30am with a flight going straight to Orlando, I got sick from lack of sleep literally the morning of before we got on the plane, my daughter, husband and son are all sick now but thankfully we made it home the next day by 12:00pm. I think it’s highly unprofessional to drastically change someone’s flight to the next day when they land and then try and make them pay for a hotel. I think had I not been pregnant and had my 2 year old with me, and returning home from a family death it wouldn’t have been as bad but I have no idea what happened to customer service.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I won't get in to the fact that their flight attendants no longer seem to take care of passengers like they appreciate the fact that we have a choice and we choose to fly with them. Or that for a family of four it's quite expensive to fly and would be nice to be treated with friendliness. What I am writing about is the fact that they can't seem to figure out flight schedules before publishing them, resulting in my family losing an entire day during a vacation that folks save up for years for. Not their problem, because hey, they can get you on the same flight a day earlier. But what they won't do is pay for a condo reservation that was booked under the pretense that we would be staying that extra day, which is past the point of being refundable. Call customer service you ask?  What a joke. After waiting on hold for over an hour, they direct you to the customer care line, where you get to wait on hold for over four hours just to be told the same thing.

"Not Verified |  I am a loyal customer to Southwest Airlines but in the past few years I have noticed a decrease in service. Two weeks ago I flew to Birmingham and on the way back to Orlando my flight was delayed over three hours. Mechanical problems so I understood. Two weeks later and here I am stuck in Vegas my flight is being delayed over four hours. I got off a four hour flight just to find out that I have to sit here four hours before getting on my way to SFO where I have family waiting to drive me up north for my granddaughters wedding. I find it difficult to believe that both my trips with in two weeks just happen to have planes with mechanical or operational failure.

"Not Verified |  My family and I bought Southwest tickets to fly to Mexico in December for my 50th birthday. Prior to flying my father contracted COVID and was also diagnosed with dementia. The hotels also put COVID restrictions into place. We called Southwest and cancelled our flights to which we were given ""Travel Funds"". Fast forward we are taking the family and going on a vacation in December, this year. We tried to book the flights using our travel funds and were told we can not due to them expiring in October. We called customer service and explained the situation and were rudely told we have to wait until they expire and then pay a $100/per ticket fee to reinstate them. We understand paying the fee and requested to pay it now to extend the date. We explained we can not wait until October to book the flights as flights are limited and are already nearly sold out. The customer service rep had zero compassion and stated there was nothing she could do that that was the policy. We asked to speak to a supervisor and were told only contact with them was through email. The email response we received only had a first name and stated there was absolutely nothing that could be done to try and resolve the problem. We called customer service again and once again explained the situation. We again said we would gladly pay the fee now and book the flights. The rep sternly responded that they are not able or willing to do anything to assist. That we would have to take our chances and wait until after October (IF they decide to take the fee and extend the funds!) or just lose all the money. They stated they gave 2 year extensions for travel plans changed due to covid, she then sarcastically stated that we did not fall in that time frame. COVID is out of our control, along with the medical problems of my father. We are not asking for a refund of the money or even asking to have a fee waived to extend the funds.

"✅ Trip Verified | Southwest wasted mine and my 2 kids day - 6 hours sitting in Dallas Love Airport. The original flight through Las Vegas was delayed, delayed and then delayed again which resulted in missing my connection. The flight was then rerouted through Denver - delayed, delayed, cancelled. The option given to me was get booked to another city and pay for a hotel in that city (my hotel rooms paid for in Spokane was not able to be utilized my myself and my family and would not be reimbursed) or I can go back home and return the next morning which I did. When I left Spokane and flew back, I was singled out by a Southwest Airlines gate attendant that my bag will not fit in the overhead. I was sitting with my extended family and was not flying out of that gate. In addition, I used this same bag that did fit in the overhead compartment on 2 different legs. She would not listen. I sat back down after measuring it confirming it was larger than was allowed - I did not check it at that point. She came back to me at my seat while I am sitting with family to continue her harassment even though I informed her I am not flying out of that gate. She ended up being that gate attendant so I checked the bag at that point. We boarded the plane (all the passengers) and were informed the plane had a fuel leak last night and was fixed. However, it was not completely repaired we had to deplane. We are going to miss our connection again. Plane was supposed to leave at 6.50 am. I sat here at 8.30 am and Southwest still does not have a resolution. Southwest airlines scheduling of their resources - whether it is personnel shortage or whatever is inexcusable.

"✅ Trip Verified | The planes are cramped, much smaller than Alaska for example. Flight attendants are rude, do not give you all of the information and do the bare minimum. They act like they’re herding cattle rather than doing customer service. Delayed flights on the first leg of the trip. When we arrived to the tarmac we sat on the plane for 45 mins (still sitting and waiting so who knows how much longer we will be here) waiting for a gate when there were easily 4 without a plane at them within my view from the window. The flight attendants then told the cabin “we are cleared to move to the gate please be seated with seatbelts on.” The plane moved all of 10 feet then we stopped and waited another 15 minutes with no communication from staff. The flight attendants were not helpful in this case. We finally into the gate we were originally planning to go into, so the original plan to find one was bogus. I ran to the next gate and barely made it. When I boarded the next plane, I asked the flight attendant if the flight was full, she said yes. I am now seated on the second flight and the plane is definitely not full (photo below of middle seats empty) We also just heard an announcement that the pilot is still on another flight, not yet landed and doesn’t know he’s going to Seattle (the current plane I'm sitting on). So I ran here, parched and didn’t get a beverage, to sit and wait for the pilot to land and come to this plane. The flight attendants are not truthful or forthcoming with customers.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Back in the day, Southwest was the best airline to fly domestically in the states. I do not know what happened. This last trip has been the worst flight experience I have ever encountered. To start my trip, I booked my flights with a longer, 2 hour layover to ensure a slight delay would not hinder my travel. This still was not the case. Southwest changed the gate and plane in Norfolk, resulting in a delay. Next, we boarded and waited for over an hour to just get gas in the plane. Meanwhile, planes scheduled after mine were boarding and taking off, in the original gate my flight was supposed to be. Almost 2 hours later, we took off. I knew I was cutting my layover short at that point, but we were scheduled to arrive with just enough time to spare. I sprinted to my gate, to see my next flight's plane sitting there. The ramp to get on was still connected to the airplane, but no one was there to check me in. I frantically looked around for someone to help me, but no one was in the area. I had to watch my plane leave without me. I then got a text stating they had rescheduled me to the next day in the evening. I went and talked to a Southwest representative, who helped change my flight to earlier in the day, but would not offer any other flights to the surrounding airports in LA for the evening. I requested they compensate and put me in a hotel, as I now had to stay overnight. I was informed that they would not put me in a hotel because they were not responsible for me missing my flight. They blamed the flight control in Norfolk, instead of taking responsibility for being very unorganized, resulting in 9 people missing their flight (to Ontario; there were many more traveling to other places). I talked to another representative to see if I could get a better boarding position, as I had the boarding position B1 prior to them sending my plane off. They had given me C13, which is considerably worse. They would still not compensate me at all. I have been unable to talk to a customer service representative, but if this is how Southwest treats their customers now, I will not be back. I did my research during the extra time I had of sitting in the airport overnight, and apparently Southwest has the highest delayed flights percentage. Two years ago, this was unheard of.

Frustrating but it was fine. As far as customer service, one of the flight attendants should find a different career.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I am extremely disappointed with this company. I booked a flight last year, but due to COVID, the trip was cancelled. I booked a flight for myself using my rapid rewards points, which were reimbursed back to my account. I also booked a flight for a friend that was flying with me. Because the flight I booked for them was not in my name (because it was for someone else flying not me), they would not reimburse the several hundred dollar flight back to my credit card. Instead, they reimbursed the credit to the other person directly. Therefore, I was out money, and I couldn't even use the credit. I contacted the business and they refused to work with me even during COVID times. I had a lot of points from when I used to have their credit card, and was going to use them to purchase my ticket. I had just shy of what I needed for a round trip ticket, so I figured I would use all the points and pay the difference. Nope, can't do that either. I had to book the flight there with points and book the flight back with a credit card. So now I have about half of plain ticket worth of points in my account that I can't use because you have to have enough for the entire flight.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Like so many other recent reviewers, I was stranded in Denver due to 'weather'. What was supposed to be a 6 hour travel day (layover included) turned out to be a 24 hour nightmare. The flight from ECP got routed to New Mexico after being told Denver was closed due to a thunderstorm. Fine. We then were stuck waiting on the plane on the ground for over an hour before it was decided we could get off while we waited for the weather to clear. This delay ended up being 5 hours. By the time we got to Denver it was damn near midnight and ofcourse all connecting flights were long gone. At that point, we had to wait in line for nearly 2 hours to speak with a southwest rep regarding what our options were. Meanwhile I was also on hold with southwest to see if I could speak with anyone on the phone. No one ever answered and I hung up after 2 hours. Upon speaking to an agent in the airport I was told that the next flight was at theend of the next day. There would be no credit, refund, hotel accomodations or even a darn blanket for the night. I was left with so many others sleeping on the floor shivering (there were no hotels, rental cars or Ubers available). Absolutely unacceptable. I ended up purchasing a flight with Delta so I could get home the next morning. I know of many other people that did the same thing. I understand that the weather is not necessarily the airline's fault, but their inability to accommodate people that are stranded and offer zero assistance is just not ok.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phoenix to Chicago,June 2021,no,    like so many other recent reviewers i was stranded in denver due to weather what was supposed to be a 6 hour travel day layover included turned out to be a 24 hour nightmare the flight from ecp got routed to new mexico after being told denver was closed due to a thunderstorm fine we then were stuck waiting on the plane on the ground for over an hour before it was decided we could get off while we waited for the weather to clear this delay ended up being 5 hours by the time we got to denver it was damn near midnight and ofcourse all connecting flights were long gone at that point we had to wait in line for nearly 2 hours to speak with a southwest rep regarding what our options were meanwhile i was also on hold with southwest to see if i could speak with anyone on the phone no one ever answered and i hung up after 2 hours upon speaking to an agent in the airport i was told that the next flight was at theend of the next day there would be no credit refund hotel accomodations or even a darn blanket for the night i was left with so many others sleeping on the floor shivering there were no hotels rental cars or ubers available absolutely unacceptable i ended up purchasing a flight with delta so i could get home the next morning i know of many other people that did the same thing i understand that the weather is not necessarily the airlines fault but their inability to accommodate people that are stranded and offer zero assistance is just not ok,like many recent reviewers stranded denver due weather supposed 6 hour travel day layover included turned 24 hour nightmare flight ecp got routed new mexico told denver closed due thunderstorm fine stuck waiting plane ground hour decided could get waited weather clear delay ended 5 hours time got denver damn near midnight ofcourse connecting flights long gone point wait line nearly 2 hours speak southwest rep regarding options meanwhile also hold southwest see could speak anyone phone one ever answered hung 2 hours upon speaking agent airport told next flight theend next day would credit refund hotel accomodations even darn blanket night left many others sleeping floor shivering hotels rental cars ubers available absolutely unacceptable ended purchasing flight delta could get home next morning know many people thing understand weather necessarily airlines fault inability accommodate people stranded offer zero assistance ok,NEG

"✅ Trip Verified |  Never used to be like this. I always get to the airport early, I arrived for my 10:40A flight 3 hours prior, knowing I was going to get some work done. As the time crept up, 1 text notification of delay. Then, I watch my app like a hawk. No additional notifications as additional three changes are made. They overfilled 2 planes with gas which delayed two gates. Then a gate change, then no gate, no gate for you, then finally another gate change. More delays without notice. Finally an additional text update. I check with customer service, we should be fine, “plenty of time to get on your connection.” 4 hours later, the flight attendant says vaguely “we don’t know if we will make it- if you live in Seattle and want to get off now” mind you, we are all buckled in at this point. No clarity on the subject, just a vague statement. We take off, we land in Denver. Congestion on the tarmac, we sit another ten minutes- Now Miami flight delayed, my hope that they’ve waited for us in the 15-20 minute window we’ve arrived. My boarding pass no longer shows boarding. No longer shows gate number or boarding number. The plane is still at the gate. I go to customer service “the doors are already closed, sorry. We can rebook you for tomorrow.” I’m in tears. Another flight attendant walks up and says we were told we would be rebooked, I tell her not true. She repeats the same vague statement, I tell her they can do better. She persists to argue with me that she was on the flight and heard it - I ignore her. Not good enough. The plane is still at the gate. I get rebooked for the next day. I have to call out tomorrow now, missing a day of work that Southwest won’t compensate me for. Oh but I get $200 in flight vouchers for their crappy airline. They book me at a quality inn.

"✅ Trip Verified | If I could title this review it would be ""30hrs in hell"". Not just one flight but every flight we had on our quick turnaround from Nashville to Bozeman was delayed, rescheduled, gates changed, lengthy waits in planes for gates, stranding in Denver overnight, just to mention a few. But my main focus here is how horribly we were treated by Southwest staff, mainly on the ground, officious in the air. They delayed us at every turn, every time we needed information or to interact with gate agents, information desk agents, even baggage agents, it was the same thing, huffs, rolled eyes, indifference even intentional misdirection. They all were rude beyond belief, lacked any empathy for my wife who was hobbling on a broken foot, no one took any responsibility for anything or offered any help. What was crazy about this was, while I hadn't flown in a few years as I'm partially retired, I flew hundreds of times on Southwest going back into the 80s and the had always been the happiest and most helpful crews and staff of any airline. Now, the wait time to get them on the phone is always ""120 minutes"", everyone was unnecessarily rude (as if there was any degree of necessary rudeness) and to a person, exuded the feeling that you were an inconvenience and not customer.

"✅ Trip Verified |  To say my last experience with Southwest was a disaster would be an understatement! It all started from day one to the very end. Beyond disappointed! To start, my flight to Long Island was supposed to be Friday at 5.45 am out of San Antonio, TX. I made sure to check in exactly 24 hours prior, as I always have, and got my confirmation and boarding pass. Then, that very same night, the day before I'm supposed to leave, I get an email from Southwest saying my flight has been changed to the following day, more than 24 hours later than my flight, due to a disruption in my itinerary? So, while I'm panicking because I needed to be in Long Island by Friday, not Saturday, I decided I was going to just show up and play dumb! So, I did! Once I arrived there, I had to talk with the customer service team due to receiving an error at the ticketing kiosk (because they changed my flight, of course). I was asked ""Umm...did you change your flight?!"" Yes, yes I did and just decided to show up a day prior! Not! So, I very politely said, ""No, I had not."" They accommodated thank goodness but, I had to fly out an hour later than expected. Okay, whatever, fine. Then comes the following Tuesday. I had this feeling in the pit of my stomach just knowing something bad was going to happen. First off, my flight from Long Island to Orlando got delayed two hours due to ""computers going down and there being nothing they can do"". Once I got on the plane, they then had us sit on the plane for 30-45 minutes because ""the plane is too heavy and they were trying to figure out numbers"". Okay, great. Now I'm starting to panic. Not to mention, while all of these delays are happening, I'm terrified I'm going to miss my other flights. I was originally supposed to be home at approximately 6pm but, due to all of the changes and issues, I got home close to 1am the next day! Another flight told us that ""they didn't have any flight attendants for the flight"" and it, too, got delayed another few hours. Just beyond livid with the way everything was handled! And, not to mention, since I got back to the San Antonio airport the next day (at 1am), I got charged $20 more for parking my car there an extra day. I just do not recommend using them going forward! They do not have anything in order and everything was in complete disarray. I will be using United or Delta going forward because, even as one of the flight attendants said to a plane full of upset people, and I quote, ""at least they (United Airlines and Delta won't be late for your flights"".

Not Verified |  Worst flight and customer service. Lost 8 hours. Plus had to pay for food. They gave me a $100 voucher. Last night I went to purchase more airfare. In October I have a flight. I went to use the voucher but it expires in September. Its currently June. I paid for the airfare so I had the flight during their 50%off. It was $850. I was on the phone for over 3 hours to use the voucher. Two agents said they cannot attach the $100 voucher whatsoever. But I can have it extended for another flight later on. I then canceled and found different airline same flight details for $50 cheaper. This is an absolute nightmare go elsewhere if you value your time. They have no customer service and will put you through loopholes. They do not value their customers and will not make it right. They just prolonged the inevitable.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight was delayed 2 hours due to systems failure. Understandable. We asked before boarding the first leg of our flight if the plane was going to continue on to Denver and we were assured it would. We booked the flight because we didn’t need to change planes, Got to Long Beach where we waited for the passengers to board when an announcement was made that the plane is being terminated/which meant they were using it to take passengers somewhere else due to all the canceled flights from the technological issues of the day. Flight crew told us to get off the plane. While waiting in line to find out what was going on, I noticed the flight crew lining up to get on another plane right next to our plane and I asked them if they were going to Denver and they all confirmed they were. Southwest decided to board a plane right next to our plane ( that was supposed to continue to Denver) with a full group of people and did not allow us to board. In other words, they backhandedly gave our seats away, boarded the crew but not us as we waited on line and took off without us. Of course when we finally got to an agent, she was showing us on the flight that we should have been on and had a challenge rerouting us for a flight and another 3 hour wait. Attached is my ticket which appears we left at 4:22 like we were supposed to. I also included the new ticket which of course was delayed. Our seats were given away right before our eyes without so much as an explanation or request from Southwest.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest Airlines had a computer glitch that caused many delays and upset people, We happened to be some of those people affected.

"Not Verified |  I’m never flying with Southwest again. Southwest canceled 1 of my 2 flights and didn’t ask or notify me about it. This morning I went to my email to check in for my flight just to see an email that had been sent at 1am in the morning that it was canceled. I bought this ticket over a week ago. I was confused so I called and was on hold for an hour, no call back option was super annoying. Soon a lady talked with me and I told her my situation and how I needed to fly out that date and how important it was to me. She then proceeded to tell me it was my fault for putting a wrong name on my ticket (which I didn’t) and then said they wouldn’t compensate me at all or give me my original flight back.

"Not Verified |  I raced to my connecting flight at Atlanta airport. My seat was sold to another, because I arrived on time. I was told it was my fault that my seat was sold to another leaving me embarrassed, spending more money to re-schedule my hotel and car rental, and then criticized in front of strangers for being late/on time to my flight. My name nor flight was never released on the overhead speakers. My experience that I will share with my family, friends, and most importantly the colleagues from my office advising me not to fly Southwest - money is the only thing Southwest acknowledges or cares about. Southwest's name makes me sick to my core. Only more money from customers who missed their flights, or will pay additional funds to take someones seat is more important than a paying customer. A supervisor came out to speak to my husband and I about the Southwest attendant speaking rude to us to another couple. The supervisor blamed me for being on time to my flight giving Southwest permission to give my seat away making it okay for the attendant to speak about me to this other couple. The reasoning for allowing the rudeness is because I was on time to my flight therefore making any rude comments from a staff member acceptable. I am in my mid-30's and will ensure I never fly Southwest or speak kindly of the company. The company only cares about money and not the future. Keep my well earned money, because it's too little to amount to the future wealth you could have had. My word of mouth will forever be negative towards this airline and staff for being rude and inconsiderate to a person paying for their service.

"Not Verified |  This is hands down the worst company I have ever interacted with. I flew a connecting flight which they changed on me. The flight was 15 minutes late arriving to our layover. A flight that was on time. My wife ran ahead of me to get to our flight. When she got there she was informed our seats had already been given away. She was in the gate area but waiting for me to catch up. Our seats were given away 10 minutes after they started boarding as were several other people. The attendant then ignored everyone trying to figure out how their tickets were given away before the plane was finished boarding. To the point where she then stated it was past their 10 minutes before departure rule, which states you need to be in the gate area not right at your gate, there was no final boarding call because they had already overcrowded the plane. The plane was so overbooked the people you sold other peoples tickets too had to come back off because there was nowhere to sit. Whoever manages your Southwest Airline employee's at Atlanta international airport is joke and has no mental comprehension of what their job is let alone to be in charge.

In fact, this was the inaugural flight! What started with optimism quickly faded to the “same old same old” disappointment.

"✅ Trip Verified | Will never fly with this airline again. Didn’t know they had “open seating,” which means that people walk on and sit wherever they please. Which is great for the people with money who can afford to upgrade to the first seating class. Not great for single parents or other families who can’t, because of you are in group C to board, you are almost guaranteed to be separated from your kids/rest of your family. As a single parent, I was furious that my kids and I were scattered throughout the plane and forced to sit next to strangers instead of as a family. The reason I was given was “they haven’t assigned seating in 50 years.” So, that makes it right? No. It doesn’t.

"Not Verified |  Absolutely terrible customer service - they indicate families with little ones can board early but we were still behind 60 passengers. While on the flight we were told our car seat was not acceptable so lap seating was ok. Then another rude male flight attendant scolded us and threatened to stop the flight if we didn’t get our 2 year old in a seat faster. I tried to explain we were told otherwise as I was placing him in a seat and not trying to cause issues. He was extremely condescending asking me multiple times his age when I had already told him he was 2. If we were refusing to comply, I’d understand his demeanor, however, that was not the case. No WiFi on the flight. Our return flight situation was an utter nightmare. The website kicked me out several times while trying to change our flights as we had a family situation. We paid the additional fee to change the flight but it was the wrong date when it kicked us to the homepage. My fault. I get it. However, the customer service agent was uncaring and charged us another $1k to rebook. They kept reiterating their policy over and over. They refused to assist us and gave us absolutely no break - told us the flight was not booked so our chances of an early boarding pass was probable. Not the case - did I mention I was on hold for nearly 3 hours to speak to someone? We’ll never fly Southwest ever again and stick to Delta, which, has always been spectacular.

"Not Verified |  I used to have no issues with this airline, until the last few flights I had with them. I upgraded my ticket to sit in row A, the very front row. During the whole flight I can over hear the flight attendants conversations, all they talked about was the passengers in a very rude way. Just gossiping about them all not knowing that the first row can hear every word they said! I looked at one of them in the eye when I heard them talking trash on the passengers, and he quickly smiled at me and changed their conversation like if nothing was said, he knew I heard what they were talking about. Very unprofessional. The next flight that day I would have to say that the flight attendants were a ton worse! I got yelled at for lowering my mask to eat a snack, in his words ""You have to raise your mask above your nose in between bites and while you chew"", I have never heard of that rule until this flight. Later that flight I fell asleep and was rudely woken up by the guy because my mask was at the tip of my nose (not under) and they threatened to ""get the captain involved"" I said go ahead. Keep in mind I'm not against masks, I'm against harassing people for your own beliefs that we can't even eat without getting yelled at. I'm 7 and a half months pregnant, and of course they never got the captain involved because that would have gone nowhere for them but make them look stupid. I could over hear the passengers talking about how rude he was because it wasn't to just me, everyone. After reading other Southwest reviews, I know this isn't happening to just me.

Well I checked into my returning flight about 16-18 hours before my flight and was still put in the C category, meaning that your one of the last groups of people to board. Not wanting to be the last group to board me and my fiancé paid $40 per person, a total of $80 to get a boarding pass in the A group. A7 and A8. Pittsburgh was to board at gate C9. While sitting there waiting to board our plane an announcement was made that all of the sudden Pittsburgh was to board at gate C11. So everyone on that flight ran over to gate C11. When we got there to board about 140 passengers were already on the flight and the guy boarding the plane said ""oh you probably won’t get to sit together since there’s so many passengers on already"". We said ""ok well we paid $80 for us to be in group A so we could sit together."" In return he said ""I made the announcement a few times in 2 hours."" Ok well if that were in fact true then everyone else would have heard him as well. I’m completely dissatisfied and disappointed with this airline. I will never use them to fly again. Your better off going somewhere elsewhere where they have assigned seating and can help you out, not ruin your whole trip. We should get reimbursed for the extra money spent since we paid and did not get what we had paid for. After landing in Pittsburgh at our destination we approached the attendant asking what we could do to get our money back for our upgraded seats and her response was, “The tickets are non refundable sorry.” So we then asked if there’s someone we can call about the issue and she said, “You can call but you still won’t get your money back.” Seriously after paying over a thousand dollars for the flights already then another $80 on top of that for upgraded seats is just ridiculous. It’s highly disappointing and I wouldn’t recommend this airline to anyone.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Chicago,June 2020,no,   i have only flown twice in my whole life my first experience was with delta air lines and it was amazing my second experience flying with southwest airlines was absolutely horrible seating is at a first come first serve basis therefore if you check in super early you are guaranteed better seating well i checked into my returning flight about 1618 hours before my flight and was still put in the c category meaning that your one of the last groups of people to board not wanting to be the last group to board me and my fiancé paid 40 per person a total of 80 to get a boarding pass in the a group a7 and a8 pittsburgh was to board at gate c9 while sitting there waiting to board our plane an announcement was made that all of the sudden pittsburgh was to board at gate c11 so everyone on that flight ran over to gate c11 when we got there to board about 140 passengers were already on the flight and the guy boarding the plane said oh you probably wont get to sit together since theres so many passengers on already we said ok well we paid 80 for us to be in group a so we could sit together in return he said i made the announcement a few times in 2 hours ok well if that were in fact true then everyone else would have heard him as well im completely dissatisfied and disappointed with this airline i will never use them to fly again your better off going somewhere elsewhere where they have assigned seating and can help you out not ruin your whole trip we should get reimbursed for the extra money spent since we paid and did not get what we had paid for after landing in pittsburgh at our destination we approached the attendant asking what we could do to get our money back for our upgraded seats and her response was the tickets are non refundable sorry so we then asked if theres someone we can call about the issue and she said you can call but you still wont get your money back seriously after paying over a thousand dollars for the flights already then another 80 on top of that for upgraded seats is just ridiculous its highly disappointing and i wouldnt recommend this airline to anyone,flown twice whole life first experience delta air lines amazing second experience flying southwest airlines absolutely horrible seating first come first serve basis therefore check super early guaranteed better seating well checked returning flight 1618 hours flight still put c category meaning one last groups people board wanting last group board fiancé paid 40 per person total 80 get boarding pass group a7 a8 pittsburgh board gate c9 sitting waiting board plane announcement made sudden pittsburgh board gate c11 everyone flight ran gate c11 got board 140 passengers already flight guy boarding plane said oh probably wont get sit together since theres many passengers already said ok well paid 80 us group could sit together return said made announcement times 2 hours ok well fact true everyone else would heard well im completely dissatisfied disappointed airline never use fly better going somewhere elsewhere assigned seating help ruin whole trip get reimbursed extra money spent since paid get paid landing pittsburgh destination approached attendant asking could get money back upgraded seats response tickets non refundable sorry asked theres someone call issue said call still wont get money back seriously paying thousand dollars flights already another 80 top upgraded seats ridiculous highly disappointing wouldnt recommend airline anyone,NEG
"✅ Trip Verified | This is a long-overdue review. I have been flying with Southwest since I was a little kid and they had ashtrays in the seats and the planes were brown. I have been an advocate for Southwest my whole life, and in college (I majored in business) we would study how Southwest excelled at customer service and ""hiring right"" when compared to other airlines. I lamented flying with other airlines because I know the way I would be treated. And finally, I signed up for the Chase credit card to fly with them more often. No more. My past 3 flights during the tail-end of the COVID pandemic have been beyond horrible. Nonsensical mask policies when compared to other airlines, I witnessed them kick a baby (a non-walking baby) off the flight due to not being able to keep a mask over its nose. Repeatedly yelled at over the coms for ""not abiding by the mask policy."" People - most of us have had it or are vaxxed. You are sacrificing the one thing that made you better than other airlines. Something tells a small room in the corporate office in Dallas are making these poor long-term, brand-ruining decision for some short-term ""I am not liable"" gain. I have a sneaky suspicion my kid brother will be studying ""the rise and fall of the Southwest Brand"" when he gets to college. I fly next month.

When I searched the flights for Tuesday there were no flights for 49.00. I called customer service and they changed my flight at no additional cost without a problem. There is no other airline that does that. I received a confirmation email before I even ended the call. That is excellent customer service.

"Not Verified |  I have to share because I am so upset! Our family has flown Southwest for years and will never fly them again! We called the airlines twice to verify the mask exemption policy for my grandson who just turned 3. After lengthy (hours) of hold times, we were told by 2 separate employees that we were to bring our doctors excuse and the exemption form from their website to the airport that day. After hearing the most recent horror stories on the news regarding them we called again this Sunday night. We were disconnected after a 2 hour wait. Then we waited on hold another two hours to be given totally different information! This lady was telling us the excuse and exemption form needed emailed in at least 7 days in advance! We were already at day 6! I asked if a supervisor could call me since this is totally different information than we were given and was told that I could get back in line and wait for one. Monday morning my daughter waited on hold two hours, got a supervisor, and was disconnected just as she started to speak. She waited another 90 minutes and was given the information of where to send in the info. She sent it in and received a receipt by email stating that they would let her know in 30 days! She called to address this and was given a number to call today and she was told to press option five. When she called the number today there was no option five! She left a message somewhere, they eventually called her back to tell her that he would’ve been approved for not wearing a mask but because it wasn’t seven days ahead of time, it wouldn’t be considered! We confirmed by actually speaking to 2 separate representatives their policy and procedure prior to purchasing tickets(which was 100% inaccurate) we followed every direction they gave us. This was their mistake! ￼They couldn't of cared less what we we were told. Southwest Airlines is the most disorganized mess! ￼￼￼￼￼￼Such poor customer service doesn’t belong in business. And it’s ridiculous that anyone under 6 wear a mask anyway. In researching many other countries airlines do not require anyone under 6 to mask!

"Not Verified |  I was planning a trip to see my daughter in Houston last year, I purchased my ticket 6/3/20 for a Nov flight.

I disconnected and called again to talk to a much more pleasant person on 5/9/21. She advised that my flight was rebooked last year by Southwest and according to the notes I was not contacted and not given the opportunity to decline the rebooking.

I was told I couldn't use my travel funds because the dates were out of range, ignoring the fact that I was not given the opportunity to refuse the rebooking last year.

"Not Verified |  Our non-stop flight from Phoenix to Tampa was great with fun staff as usual. The return non-stop flight was cancelled due to weather. My husband and I were booked on different returning flights with multiple stops. After paying for a hotel at the airport and directly speaking to a Southwest employee, we were able to get a flight out the next morning together with only one stop. The flight was a nightmare. Staff was rude and mean about demanding their covid restrictions (which was not the case on our original flight to Tampa). Our masks (which we wore on the original flight) were NOT accepted by this staff and we were forced to wear their blue, chemical laden masks on top of our own masks. We were then hassled throughout the flight to be sure our noses were covered, even though I observed several other passengers with their masks below their noses. At the end of the flight the most militant of the staff announced that we should stay in our seats until our row's turn in order to ""maintain social distancing""!!! Hilarious since we had all just spent 2 1/2 hours eating our snacks with no masks and being stuffed into seats at full occupancy. I had to laugh out loud.

I was flying to Portland from Ontario, CA, with a stop in Sacramento. I was going to see my Mother in Salem, her health had deteriorated rapidly after falling and breaking her hip.

I called and the support person said because I didn't cancel the flight, and didn't inform them, that my return trip was canceled and money forfeited. I guess I forgot to read the fine print. Because of this policy, even though I felt it more important to get to my Mother's side, I now didn't have a return flight. I used to fly Southwest.

"✅ Trip Verified | I've previously written about four negative experiences that I had in a row flying on SWA. I still had a small travel voucher that I didn't want to go to waste, so I decided to use it. My experience was average, I suppose. While I've also written generally glowing reviews about SLC airport, the SWA check-in staff at SWA were blasé. Not rude, not mean, but also not remotely interested-acting or helpful. Just robotic. I even get more helpful service on United (relatively speaking, and that says something). Same for the SWA gate staff. As for flight staff, the flight attendants were a mix of very cheery and upbeat (almost scarily so), or yeah, blasé and even kind of bossy to and barking orders at passengers. Not very helpful. At least the FA I had to interact with for the most part was the cheery and upbeat one. Once at Houston Hobby, it took almost 30 minutes to retrieve checked baggage from the carousel, while this may be more of a Hobby airport personnel problem, this is a problem that Southwest needs to address with airport management, as the airport is an airline hub. On the bright side, the plane was almost spanking new and very clean. The snack and Coke served were delicious. The plane was only about half occupied, though I don't know whether that has to do with bookings and demand, or with the fact that we're still in a pandemic. Social distancing was possible and enforced, as a result. Overall summary: at least this flight experience on SWA was average rather than hostile, so I guess that's an improvement for this airline. I still wouldn't recommend, as it will take many more average or above-average flights with them to convince me that they're not actually the worst airline in the USA (and I'm far more willing to fly on Delta or Alaska normally anyway for domestic flights).",Family Leisure,Economy Class,Midway to Fort Myers,March 2021,no,   ive previously written about four negative experiences that i had in a row flying on swa i still had a small travel voucher that i didnt want to go to waste so i decided to use it my experience was average i suppose while ive also written generally glowing reviews about slc airport the swa checkin staff at swa were blasé not rude not mean but also not remotely interestedacting or helpful just robotic i even get more helpful service on united relatively speaking and that says something same for the swa gate staff as for flight staff the flight attendants were a mix of very cheery and upbeat almost scarily so or yeah blasé and even kind of bossy to and barking orders at passengers not very helpful at least the fa i had to interact with for the most part was the cheery and upbeat one once at houston hobby it took almost 30 minutes to retrieve checked baggage from the carousel while this may be more of a hobby airport personnel problem this is a problem that southwest needs to address with airport management as the airport is an airline hub on the bright side the plane was almost spanking new and very clean the snack and coke served were delicious the plane was only about half occupied though i dont know whether that has to do with bookings and demand or with the fact that were still in a pandemic social distancing was possible and enforced as a result overall summary at least this flight experience on swa was average rather than hostile so i guess thats an improvement for this airline i still wouldnt recommend as it will take many more average or aboveaverage flights with them to convince me that theyre not actually the worst airline in the usa and im far more willing to fly on delta or alaska normally anyway for domestic flights,ive previously written four negative experiences row flying swa still small travel voucher didnt want go waste decided use experience average suppose ive also written generally glowing reviews slc airport swa checkin staff swa blasé rude mean also remotely interestedacting helpful robotic even get helpful service united relatively speaking says something swa gate staff flight staff flight attendants mix cheery upbeat almost scarily yeah blasé even kind bossy barking orders passengers helpful least fa interact part cheery upbeat one houston hobby took almost 30 minutes retrieve checked baggage carousel may hobby airport personnel problem problem southwest needs address airport management airport airline hub bright side plane almost spanking new clean snack coke served delicious plane half occupied though dont know whether bookings demand fact still pandemic social distancing possible enforced result overall summary least flight experience swa average rather hostile guess thats improvement airline still wouldnt recommend take many average aboveaverage flights convince theyre actually worst airline usa im far willing fly delta alaska normally anyway domestic flights,NEU

"✅ Trip Verified | The flight with them went very well going to Florida, but the staff we had going back to Las Vegas were horrible. When we boarded our flight, I asked 2 flight attendants if I had time to go and change my 11 month old daughters diaper before take off, one flight attendant said that I would have time to as we had about 5 minutes before take off and the other was not so happy about the idea and had an attitude. My son is autistic and wearing a mask for him is uncomfortable and he cries hysterically if it’s on, the flight attendant that was not happy about me going to change my daughters diaper proceeded to tell me that my son needed to wear a mask, I explained to her his situation and she gave me a dirty look and went to the front of the plane to tell her co-worker.

I went back to my seat and my son was crying hysterically and screaming at the top of his lungs because of the mask I had put on him. We take off and we’re in the air and I see about 3-4 people get up to use the bathroom. As soon as I get up with my daughter thinking it was a good time to change her, the flight attendant talks on the intercom and tells everyone to stay sitting until the seat belt lights are off, I was so angry at this point because they never said anything up until I stood up to finally go and change her diaper.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight 6216 Southwest Airlines January 5, 2021 scheduled to depart Denver airport at 3:40 PM. The flight did take off and land safely at the destination, BWI airport. My checked bag arrived as it should. There is nothing else I have to write that is a positive comment about the way this flight was handled. First of all many of the passengers were not wearing their masks as required in the waiting area before boarding the flight. Some of the same passengers, at least 23 by my count, boarded the plane without their masks covering their mouths and noses. They walked in this manner by the Southwest flight attendants and were not stopped or directed to comply with the rules. A lady and an Asian man seated themselves in seats 4b and 4c. They began taking about liberty and their freedoms and would not wear their masks. Seats 4d, 4e and 4f. had passengers that would not wear their masks properly and they began discussing liberty and freedom loudly. The spoke to a passenger nearby that indicated they should comply with the rules since we have a global pandemic. Those passengers commented that their is no pandemic and the new media has promoted a hoax. All of the sickness is a hoax including the media, the drug companies and the liberal media. It is difficult for a crew to control morons. The crew did have several opportunities to not allow these individuals on the plane to begin with. If they will not comply in the boarding area then they must not be allowed to board. Other passengers and I purchased our tickets to fly based upon the contract and trust that Southwest would not allow passengers on the plane if they would not comply. For the first 30 minutes the Captain and the First Officer did not turn on condition air to save Southwest money. Once security removed the lady that was ranting, denigrating the flight attendants and other passengers, the Captain and First Officer did get the air conditioning going. The flight remained at gate C27 for another hour as the crew sorted the mess. Several passengers never wore their masks properly. I do not want to get COVID and you do not either. Southwest executives must believe times are normal and have forgotten the raging pandemic. The boarding process jammed people next to each other in the name of loading quickly. The lineup of passengers in the aisle was jammed with many passengers in contact with each other. The paln had few empty seats. Wake up airline executives, you have lost me as a customer until the pandemic is over. I do not recommend flying any commercial fight until the airline executives from ever airline realize they must take a loss for the time and hold planes to a 50% capacity until the pandemic is over. Passenger safety should be the most important goal of any airline. Getting sick with the possibility of death from the illness is a definite threat. If you can charter a plane or have your own plane these issues will not affect you. Commoners like me will drive of find another way to get safely to any destination I must go to for work. Otherwise I am following the Governor's orders and minimizing any travel and recommend that to everyone. There is no reason not to wear a mask. I tried Southwest and you failed me.

"Not Verified |  On January 3rd 2021, I arrived to ORF with 2 checked bags, a book bag personal item, and early bird seating. We were off to Nashville around 1500 with dense fog noted. Soon (10 minutes?) after takeoff, it seemed like we were not ascending as usual. The cabin became unusually hot and there was an awful plastic/metal smell with some vibrations that I thought was just turbulence. The captain came overhead to inform us we had struck a flock of birds and we were returning to Norfolk to service the engine. The next 20 minutes were terrifying as we glided back down to safety and I applaud the flight crew for returning us safely...however the next few events following this incident is where I have some issues with southwest. I have always enjoyed flying with southwest airlines and I am an easy customer to please. I frequently travel and understand that there are some circumstances that flight crews and airport personnel can not control. However, I found the way that Southwest dealt with the situation was despicable and disrespectful. A simple phone-call to follow-up after a terrifying incident would have sufficed. However, I want to acknowledge how great the employees were at the gate dealing with the rescheduling issue and the flight crew (unless they failed to report it...). We all exited the plane and were asked to wait in the terminal. Everyone was confused and no one was sharing information and there was only 1 person to help direct all 180 of us on what to do next...(she was awesome, thus the 5 star ground rating). The flight was canceled and I was pleased that SW attempted to reschedule me to get to my final destination to MKE (Nashville was my connection). I ended up asking to change the one they rescheduled (Orf to orlando to MKE) and flew directly to Chicago and drove up to Mke from there. So...never heard word from southwest about the incident, do I get money back? I know that direct to Chicago was cheaper. And I didn't get my early bird status. I checked the FAA bird strike database, not even reported...I hope they actually inspected/serviced that airbus. The next day I was happy because I called and asked where my checked bags were and the very helpful lady informed me that she would make sure they made it to MKE from Nashville (I'm glad those people who waited for that rescheduled flight got to go!) and SW called me when my bags were ready to be picked up.But all in all, I am super salty that our plane hit birds and had to turn around and was not once addressed by the airline.

Tickets were cheap and quality followed. My initial (12:40pm) flight time was delayed until (6:50pm), gate was changed 3 or 4 times and no real explanation given.

"✅ Trip Verified | I must share my recent experience. I love flying Southwest, the employees are fun and accommodating, but this year which has been a tough year for the whole world and to top it off as an active military family we were recently put on orders to move out of state, making this year even more emotional and scary having to travel. Well while flying out of Ontario CA. On 11/28/2020 my husband, son and I were waiting to board and as usual Southwest has always treated military greatly so we wait for A listers and group A to board, usually small children and active duty is called next to board but we understand that doesn’t happen every time everywhere, well my husband approached the operations employee and kindly in a soft low tone asked do you allow military to board early here? Well a simple sorry sir no would of sufficed, but he just gave the most annoyed attitude tone and said “No we don’t, and you can go read online if you want” he didn’t even allow my husband to finish his sentence and he was extremely rude. Wait! You think that’s all oh no, we waited for our group and number to walk up and he looked at my husband and said “wait let me check that it really is your turn”, he didn’t want to let us on the plane until he made sure he verified all three of our tickets as if we were too incompetent to read the big letter and number on the boarding pass. I could feel and sense his anger and annoyed mood towards us with just his stare. I’m not one to give reviews much but this really bothered my heart and mind. A smile and a positive attitude can make a huge difference in a person but not bigger than a negative attitude and a frown. Flight 1258 out of Ontario, I will forever remember your rudeness and lack of care toward the military member “my husband” that has volunteered to serve so that your family doesn’t have to be drafted, so that all that freedom you have is possible and so that your personal family can feel safe. We do not expect special privileges but we do expect common respect and good customer service, as anyone should for choosing Southwest Airlines.

"✅ Trip Verified | At the point of boarding the plane, I was verbally accosted by the gate agent who rudely embarrassed me by loudly stating I had too many carry on items to board the plane and that I needed to ""go over there and check something."" I politely tried to tell the woman that I had a bag with food for the flight and a fleece jacket in it. Didn't matter. I was accused of having a fanny pack when I was wearing a waist belt in lieu of carrying a purse. I had a mini backpack with chargers that per Southwest, are not supposed to be checked in baggage and a small suitcase. I was not given an opportunity to combine anything. I do not consider a waist belt, which I was wearing and is similar to a money belt or passport belt, to be a carry on item. It takes up no more space on my body than a belt on my pants. I never remove the waist belt and it does not impede sitting in a single seat or fastening my seatbelt. I do not consider food that I was going to eat in flight, especially as I was taking an antibiotic at that time for a GI condition, to be a carry on item. There were many, many other passengers who were carrying food on the plane in addition to other carry on items. I have never heard of a coat/jacket being considered as a carry on item. When I left Phoenix it was almost 90 degrees. When I arrived in Detroit 4 hours later, the temperature was about 45. To say a jacket/coat was necessary is an understatement. The gate agent was incredibly and unnecessarily rude. I was embarrassed unnecessarily in front of other passengers waiting to board. I have GI issues and cannot eat anything that might have been served in flight. Taking my own food on a 4 hour flight did not seem unreasonable. The mini backpack I had is about the size of an ordinary shoe box. Had I been given the chance, I would have combined items (except the waist belt) but I was denied that opportunity. I submitted a complaint to Southwest post-flight and received an email that in essence, blamed me for having so many carry on items, quoted a number of Southwest policies on baggage as if I do not know how to read and more importantly, failed to provide what I consider to be a sincere apology or any language about the gate agent receiving any kind of coaching, reprimand or training to correct her inappropriate behavior. In other words, it was all my fault. I am not ok with that. I have flown Southwest many times in the past and never had this kind of experience. I hope to never fly Southwest again. Public humiliation is uncalled for, period. Not being given a chance to ""fix"" my ""mistake"" and being ordered around rudely and loudly like a bad child is uncalled for.

"Not Verified |  Last week, my husband and I flew Southwest to Orlando. Flight was good until the end. The flight attendant had the supervisors call the cops on us. There was 4 cops & 2 supervisors waiting for us in the gate when you walk off the plane. Obviously face masks are required during the flight, unless you were eating or drinking. During the flight, my husband fell asleep and I put my earbuds in and started drawing. He slept with a neck pillow and his face mask would catch on the pillow and slightly fall lower than his nose. The flight attendant woke him up a couple times and asked him to pull it back up. He apologized and went back to sleep. As far me, I went into my purse to grab 2 mints and a protein bar. I pulled my face mask down to put the mint in my mouth. The flight attendant snapped and told me to put my mask back on, I said I was eating. She said, “it’s only a mint and if this is going to be an issue, I’ll call the supervisor!” And stormed off. We land and get off the plane only to be greeted by the cops. The cops questioned us on what happened on the flight. The cop told us that face to face conflict/confrontation was reported from the flight attendant and that’s why they were called. The supervisor looked up our return flight and revoked them. All over sleeping and eating a mint. The flight attendant might have had a bad day but it’s not enough justification to go out of your way to wreck our trip. Her behavior is unacceptable. I understand you want to keep everyone safe. But you’re taking it too far. Not once did we raise our voice, or stand up and cause issues. Revoking our tickets over something this small, is unbelievable. If it’s that big of deal to eat on the flight, then stop serving water and snacks.

"✅ Trip Verified | First and last time flying Southwest. Likely the worst airline I have flown to date. From check in to leaving the terminal it was a terrible experience. The kiosks were not working and the customer service woman was incredibly rude and not willing to help. This first come first serve seating is absurd. The flight attendants looked like they couldn’t be bothered and were busy chatting. I got chastised for taking my 4 year old to the bathroom when the seatbelt sign was on - for those who have children - a child they age can’t hold it when they have to go. I know all airlines have to impose a mask rule during COVID - but only allowing certain kinds of masks is outrageous. What is even more infuriating is the way they treat children and the parents when they can’t/won’t wear a mask. One woman was not let on the flight because her 2 year old wouldn’t wear a mask. How can any 2 year old be expected to wear a mask? In my opinion, this is overboard. I fly several times a month and this is the only airline that treats people this poorly.

The following mid afternoon I received a call that my bag was thought to have been stolen off the baggage belt. Knowing my luggage would be there at 10pm, is it to much to ask that it be secured in the baggage claim area? The associates failed to do so.

"✅ Trip Verified |  This is a review of Southwest customer service. I had to have a representative book my husband's return flight after a three week battle over Rapid Rewards points I'd purchased. That battle was more than enough; multiple calls, points never showing up, had to purchase the points again. I wasn't able to book the flight myself because of the points situation, so I called in. I told the representative I needed to book my husband on my flight. The itineraries were related and my flight was in the system. She said she put him on my flight. She did not. When I opened the email about an hour later, I realized it was the wrong flight. I tried to call; they close at 3 pm AZ time. I called the next morning thinking it was very annoying to have to call again but that they would change it. To my surprise, I was told they were not going to change it and I could pay the difference to switch him to my flight. A $478 difference on a $91 flight. They are insistent that they will do nothing even though it is abundantly clear that the representative blatantly booked the wrong flight. They do admit she booked the wrong flight and never told me which flight she booked, but it was my fault for ""not checking."" Stupid on my part, but I didn't realize I needed to check the work of a representative in the highest customer service department of the airline.

"Not Verified | Today, on 08/22/20 Flight 1541 at 07:40am, a Southwest pilot (never revealed his name) went above and beyond for a 12-year-old who was extremely terrified flying the first time by herself (yes, she thought she was brave enough to do it). The crew tried to calm her and she continuously screamed that she wanted to go home. One flight attendant held her hand, everyone tried to calm her, and the pilot apparently let her into the cockpit (prior to taxi away) to hopefully ease her fears. She eventually calmed down. The same pilot then proceeded to escort her off the plane, bought her breakfast from Chick-fil-A, and took her to her next gate! I can't even begin to express the gratitude.

"Not Verified |  I have a Southwest travel fund for $167 that expires Sept. 17, 2020. I had planned to use it this Spring, until national restrictions due to Covid-19 prevented my travel. In May, a Southwest travel rep reassured me the travel fund expiration date was extended to Dec. 17, 2020. I was SO relieved because $167 is a good amount of money I didn't want to lose, and I couldn't travel again any earlier than October 2020. But when I tried to book my flight (in June), I got an error message that said my travel fund expiration date was Sept. 17, 2020. I immediately called Southwest customer service to explain that I was told the wrong expiration date by one of their reps and due to Covid-19 health concerns and regional restrictions, I can't use my travel credit until October 2020. FUN FACT: Did you know... Southwest is extending the expiration date for travel funds that expire between March 1 and Sept. 7, 2020, to now expire Sept. 7, 2022? That now gives travelers 2 YEARS to use their travel credit. I have to assume they've done this to protect the health of those Southwest fliers who don't feel safe flying any time soon and in the midst of Covid-19. What a nice, and very practical, gesture! Let me remind you my travel fund expiration date is Sept. 17, 2020. And because it falls 10 days later, my own health and safety is NOT prioritized by Southwest travel policy-makers. Instead, I'm forced to use my $167 travel fund by Sept 17, 2020 and risk not only my own health, but that of my friends, family and fellow fliers -- or it disappears forever. I spoke with several reps (including a customer relations manager) and none of them gave a damn that I couldn't use my travel fund, when I was initially told by one of their reps that it expired on Dec. 17, 2020.

"✅ Trip Verified |  We fly Southwest for their easy, fast ticketing and reasonable pricing. Yesterday was the first time since 1999 that an attendant failed to use common sense, a trait Southwest is known for. Staff in Denver announced loud and clear that we are allowed 2 bags only to board. That's always been the rule, however, countless times common sense is applied first, written rules second. I have boarded many, many times with my small over the shoulder purse, small backpack, and my carry-on suitcase. ( this was my return trip from Denver! i had traveled 4 days ago in identical fashion) I watched closely as others boarded ... 3 large bags, a woman with 4 items, one fellow had 2 large items, neither fit under the seat, and so on and so on. He never stopped anyone, so i knew his announcement was just routine in the case he truly had to limit someone. I was the last to board with B 21. (flight not even close to full) He stopped me and asked me to please put my purse into my backpack. My purse and backback are small, i am a small person, nothing was even hanging outside of my person. Both items were so empty they easily fit together. Both items tucked under the seat did not even fill 50 percent of the space. Why did he even bother? Why did he have to make one person's experience less than pleasant. In B 21 I was the last person. Flight was not even half full. There's no good reason for him to do what he did. The lady with 4 bags was so loaded down in size and bulk that she held up the entire plane for deplaning.

✅ Trip Verified |  I'm writing this with a heavy heart and a serious headache. I booked a flight on Mar 27 for May 11 on April 5th southwest changed the flight. I got an email and was told to rebook online at no additional cost. By that time Jamaica had closed the boarder and the situation was so uncertain so I asked to be refunded instead of changing or being credited. They told me no my only options were the two previously stated. I told them that it was unfair for me to be stuck on their timeline since it was ever changing. Anyway with no other option I revoked for May 22. That was canceled and I got an email notification. I changed again to June 6. Now june 6 was being held based on the multiple conversations I had with CSR. I applied for my leave days and everything based on the information provided by their app stating that my flight was still on. A few days before my flight I called southwest because of an Instagram post I saw about international flights entering orf having issues only to find out that my flight was canceled days before without notification. I lost wage revenue since my leave days were already booked with my company and now I have to request additional days to actually going to VA. Then they called and offered me a voucher like that was somehow going to help my situation. I cant pay bills or eat using a southwest travel voucher.

"Not Verified |  The problem is really with the website and customer service. I was charged more than expected when I booked online, I had called to get it fixed and it was only partially addressed as I discovered when my credit card statement arrived. I called again and after spending an hour on the phone, I was told by the agent that he could not help me with anything involving charges to my credit card. I was stunned that we had spent so much time on the phone if he couldn't help with my issue.

Our family witnessed this personally and Southwest had flown many planes empty to the Dominican to bring our people home. The best part was the crew of this flight showed all of us so much attention, and treated everyone great.

✅ Trip Verified |  I had the worst experience ever with South West airlines Houston. I waited at baggage claim for over 30 minutes for my bag which never came while over the speaker the announcer called for the owner of a crown royal bag. As you may know Crown Royal is a liquor that comes in a purple and gold bag but this couldn’t be my bag even though it was purple and gold it clearly said Betsy Johnson all over it. I guess that was a funny joke for the employees to yell on the loud speaker that owner of a crown royal bag needed to come to the service desk. After realizing my bag was not coming I was directed to a room in the back where I inquired about the location of the bag. The airport staff then said oh you’re the owner of the Crown Royal bag and began to giggle. They informed that my bag fell and was ran over and some of my stuff have been destroyed with not even the smallest hint of remorse. My bag was literally destroyed to the point all the clothes and shoes In it were ripped to shreds / destroyed. When I became angry the south west employee asked me “what are you so mad about it’s not like we are not going to cut you a check”. I explained to the worker that I am in a city I have never been to with absolutely nothing to wear and all my belongings destroyed. The employee began to tell me how southwest is a million dollar company & they have no problem cutting a check as if this was suppose to make me feel better. The employee then told me it happens all the time due to southwest handling so much luggage on a daily basis and they just cut a check. The employees asked me to go through my bag and damages and asked me to price the cost of each item. The south west employee sat on the computer googled my items one by one while making comments like “ woah you really paid $200 for that ?” and arguing with me over the amount I paid for each item saying things like “ well they have it for cheaper at this store”. The worker also went as far to turn to his employee and say “ I don’t even argue with these people” After the employee calculated what he felt I deserved for my belongings he wrote a check for $620 and told me I should just go to the mall & buy new items. The employee told me I can go to chase bank and cash the check the same day which was a lie. I went to chase bank and they told me they could not cash check because southwest had to verify it and no one answered the phone. I was not able to cash check until I returned home from my vacation.

"✅ Trip Verified | Houston to Denver via Dallas. I've even had better luck flying on United, and that's saying a lot considering United's abysmal reputation! To begin with my stories - Most recent flight, October 2019, Denver back to Houston: Unremarkable flight. Southwest check-in agent in Denver who collected my checked baggage was ""mechanically"" professional but lacked much in the way of personality. Upon arrival at Houston, baggage was oh, so slow to come out! Second most recent flight, October 2019, Houston via Dallas to Denver: Southwest check-in agent in Houston who collected my checked baggage was ""mechanically"" professional, again. Gate agents in both Houston and Dallas acted quite bored, honestly. I didn't notice the splotches of dried drink, food chunks and blood (yes, that is correct, blood) surrounding my seat until I sat down, and I had to sit down because I was one of the last people to board the plane. I sent Southwest a scathing review of that flight and got a $75 credit for a future flight for what it's worth. Third most recent flight, May 2019, Austin to Albuquerque then back to Austin: Any Southwest staff I interacted with at either airport couldn't be paid enough, it seems, to even bother to pleasantly interact with staff. That said, I remember the pilot on the first leg, from Austin to Albuquerque, trying to engage the passengers, so good for him! Fourth most recent flight, October 2018, Dallas to Louisville: The man who checked in my baggage at the curb barely said a word or even grunted, and even fairly forcefully threw said baggage onto the carousel even after I had told him that I have fragile items within! No ""thank you,"" no ""this is your ticket and go this way to your gate,"" nothing!

"Not Verified |  Southwest really “flew the extra mile” today in terms of demonstrating just how terrible they are at customer service. After a 1.5 hr delay in leaving the West Coast, they informed passengers that they had informed the connecting flights to wait a bit so that passengers could make their connections. We land in the Midwest and I rush to my connection, only to find out that 1) No one had bothered to inform this flight crew that there were delayed passengers rushing to catch this flight; 2) my plane was literally sitting right there, on the other side of the glass, and they refused to let me on because they had already counted the passengers; 3) the next connection was 3.5 hours later - but oh wait that was delayed another 1.5 hrs too. So even though the two flights that I needed to catch were more than 1.5 hours delayed, they couldn’t hold this one for a few minutes. And then, when they gave me a ticket for the last flight of the day, they put me on one of the last groups for seating, and because Southwest doesn’t assign seats then it just means you will have a horrible seat. I pressed and they gave me seating after the first group. Fast forward four hours later on a late Sunday evening after traveling all day, and it looks like a small group of passengers DID get to board before everyone because they were from a connecting flight. So apparently, Southwest does not care at all if it’s one or a few persons being royally screwed by every one of their actions. All the while, the staff who answered my questions responded curtly, seemed annoyed, and one manager simply stared at me and asked what I wanted in deadpan voice after the person at the desk explained the situation.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Rochester to Providence via Baltimore. These two flights took place amidst the winter storm which struck the Northeast in early December of 2019. As usual, for these short flights, we were offered beverages and pretzels. The gate agents for both flights were excellent and got us boarded quickly, but the issue was that we were delayed for both flights due to de-icing and such. The flight attendants did a good job of balancing the occasional need for speed with the need for passenger respect.

"✅ Trip Verified | Rochester to Las Vegas via Baltimore and Salt Lake City. The flight from Rochester to Baltimore was operated on a Boeing 737-700, while the flight from Baltimore to Salt Lake City (and onward to Las Vegas) was operated on a Boeing 737-800. We had some comedians as flight attendants on these flights! The first two kind of struggled to get us to laugh. The third, however was absolutely hilarious! I noticed several indirect advertisements for Southwest's new flights to Hawaii through joking we had just landed in Hawaii. The flight from Rochester to Baltimore featured the usual beverage service and packet of pretzels, as did the flight from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas. For the flight from Baltimore to Salt Lake City (which was much longer), there were two beverage services, and we were offered shortbread cookies or Fritos, or both. As usual, inflight entertainment was available, but only if you had a streaming device with you. I don't know why, but for some reason, I felt like the flight attendants on the first two of these flights were a little less friendly than I've experienced in the past on Southwest. Not hostile, but just kind of passive-yet also a little impatient with passengers as they boarded (like during previous flights). I guess my biggest gripe is the food. I know it's a low-cost carrier, and I know it's a domestic flight in the U.S. But somehow, for a flight that lasts for something like five hours, I feel like people really ought to be offered more than just a couple of packets of snacks.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Providence to Rochester via Baltimore. Two quick flights, and pretty much without incident. I was accompanying my parents, and one of them (my Dad) needed special assistance. For some reason, the gate agent in Providence said only one person was allowed to accompany my Dad during preboarding. My Mom opted to do so. The gate agent in Baltimore, however, said both my Mom and I could accompany my Dad during preboarding. During the flights, complimentary beverages were offered, as were packets of pretzels. Apparently wi-fi is available, as well as a few movies if you brought your tablet or smartphone or whatever to watch them on. The flight attendants were generally pleasant, but seemed a little bit impatient at times. I recognize that these were short flights and that they had schedules to keep (which they did indeed keep, to their credit), but it seemed like people generally were not going particularly slowly as it was, despite Southwest's unique boarding technique of having people choose their own seats.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Ontario to Denver. Take their no show policy seriously. Ten hours travel, my elderly mother appeared to have a stroke and was transported to a local emergency room. Numerous tests were being done because of the concern for her wellbeing, and the doctor was less than sure about what the cause was. Being an only child, I stayed with my mom during this process, getting her to agree to treatment, explaining what the doctors were telling her, and trying to keep her calm. The furthest thing from my mind was our planned travel to go to her college friends funeral in Colorado. While they were doing a procedure, I got the email that we missed the flight - that is how fast time flied. I immediately called, and they said it was too late, but that I should contact the corporate consumer line. Much later that day, when I left the hospital, I immediately went to the airport, and they also recommended that I contact the corporate consumer line. The staff member at the airport was understanding and encouraged me to reach out because the company is known to make exceptions. So I did. In response was an automatic, non-empathetic, “you didn’t meet our rules email”. It was clear the author never read anything I wrote, that the author never came close to the sympathy advanced by phone representative or airport representative. That the author utilized the cut and paste function to get through its tasks. The moral of the review - keep the southwest number on your favorites if you are traveling. That you have a sick family member in the emergency room is not a reason to miss the deadline or not call them to cancel. That their mission statement claiming “dedication to the highest quality of Customer Service delivered with a sense of warmth, friendliness” are words on a website, not words that consider any tragedy that may befall you or your family, unless they can advertise it for their advantage.

"✅ Trip Verified |  In mid September, my husband and I took a short flight from Oakland to Portland, as we were moving up to our new place in Portland. I packed my wedding flatware, which I use for special occasions in my check in luggage, thinking that if I added it to my carry on, they could consider it to be dangerous. Up to this point, the other issue I had with Southwest over luggage was a few years ago when they smashed up my Samsonite luggage from OAK to Long Beach. They did correct the situation by reimbursing me for the damage. However, when I arrived at PDX and our new place, I did not unpack all of my luggage immediately, since we had 4 bags between the two of us. A few days after we landed, I looked for my flatware and found it was missing, except for the butter knives. Someone took out the 12 dinner forks, 12 salad forks, 12 Soup spoons and 12 teaspoons, I called Southwest right away and was told that they would process the claim. When I called customer service, I begged and pleaded for them to find it and return it to me. I don't even want the money for the flatware, I just wanted the flatware because it was sentimental to me.

"Not Verified |  Baltimore to Pittsburgh. As I boarded this SW flight, and was attempting to get a seat, utilizing Southwest’s ‘open seating’ policy, the attendant blocked me from getting to a seat, stating he was holding the seats for others. Because I asked him repeatedly about the Southwest policy that he was not adhering to, he got loud stating that I need to find another seat. I did and apparently I needed to have a ‘cheery’ disposition, because before I knew it, another attendant was in my face telling me I need to listen to the attendants. I was already in a seat and was lost as to what she was talking about, sure enough another employee who was not even with the crew, comes on board and is now demanding that I verbally answer him, when he tells me I need to listen to the attendants (and no I was not in the emergency exit, nor was I doing any duties for the airline). So yes we are back in kindergarten and I answered him, but that too was not good enough, because he provides his rendition to the captain and I was told to leave the plane. I was not loud, nor drunk, nor physically abusive, I did not raise my voice, nor did I cause a commotion. And now I am told to leave the plane because 1 person, decided to take his frustration out on me. I did nothing wrong to anyone on that plane, nothing wrong to anyone in the airport and Southwest can justify people making decisions like this. If you are frustrated with your job before 9:00am then why does Southwest have morning flights? Clearly the employees do not want to deal with customers during certain hours.

"Not Verified |  This is the umpteenth time our flight has been delayed a ridiculous amount. Today it is delayed now 3 hours which puts us at our connection at the time it should leave, most likely without us. Southwest used to be the best, easiest, and most convenient and all of that seems to have ended. I choose Southwest for many years now because I’ve always enjoyed the company more than others. Now it’s smartest to go with the most affordable, since the only things that make Southwest stand out anymore are negative. The free bags used to be nice, now it’s cheaper to pay someone to check them.

✅ Trip Verified | We had to fly from Phoenix to LAX where we had a connecting flight from LAX to London from there. Our Southwest plane was 40 min late and we were running short on being able to make our connection flight in LA. Southwest announced that they were offering early boarding and early exiting for the late flight for $30 per person. We talked to Southwest employee about waiving that fee for us since the plane was late and jeopardized our connection flight. The employee said she couldn’t do that for us because we should have allowed more time for the connection flight. We had 3 hours. It seems that when Southwest is late it uses that to sell their customers early boarding and early exits because they know people with connecting flights are now running late and are forced to purchase these $30 extra tickets.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Las Vegas to Orlando via Nashville. On August 22 flight #2421 was over 20 minutes late arriving in Las Vegas. This caused the flight to leave Las Vegas over 50 minutes late this jeopardizing our connection flight #1296 in Nashville. The flight attendants then said they will hold the plane in Nashville until we arrive there. However, we paid for the early bird check-in because Southwest doesn't assign seats for their passengers. In order for you and your family members to sit together, you have to purchase the early bird check-in which assures you a place in line within the first 60 people. This does not work if your flight is delayed coming in and your connecting flight already boards everyone even the people who didn't pay for the early bird check-in. So you get screwed and lose your place in line which you paid for. So when they boarded us onto flight #1296 and we tell the flight attendant that we paid for the early bird check-in. The flight attendant says well we waited 20 minutes for your flight to get in. How is that the passenger's fault that the flight go in late? So they tell us to sit in the only available seats which are center seats not even in the same row. Also to make matters worse the seats are sandwiched in between 2 larger than normal-sized people. So I had to squeeze between 2 large people and my husband got to sit next to a 350lbs man who was partially in his seat so much so that he had to lay his tray table down to lean on it for the entire flight. Did the flight attendants care? Of course not because they herd people like cattle on these aeroplanes, they don't care if your flight is uncomfortable. The flight lasted 1 hour and 23 minutes to Orlando. When we got home. I called Southwest Customer Service and the only thing they said they can do from their end is to refund us the $12.50 each that we paid for the early bird check-in. They said to call their Customer Relations Department. On 8/30/19 I call Customer Relations and explain to the representative the situation and the terrible experience and she said she can only refund us $50 each in travel vouchers towards another Southwest flight. So this airline company takes your money, gives you a terrible flight experience and only gives you $50 each for your unsatisfactory experience due to their flights not keeping on schedule. I told the representative if Southwest assigned seats in the first place it would not have been a problem because no one would have sat in someone else's seat. We pay for the early bird boarding to get within the first 60 people on a plane so parties can sit together. Looking back in hindsight my husband and I should have walked off the plane and asked to be put on another plane where we would be able to board within the early bird boarding and not lose our place in line.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Orlando to Milwaukee via Atlanta. Arriving to the airport from a business trip to be notified the flight was an hour delayed. Frustrating but understandable. Things can happen. A little over a hour later, received a text that the flight was canceled. Although it does text you new flights available, the process makes you pay for the new flight, so I didn’t process but went to the counter at the gate. There were over 50 people in a line dealing with the same situation. There were two ladies working the counter (there were additional stations open that more employees could have been deployed to move the line faster). I was in this line for 1 1/2 hours. Once it was my turn, no greeting from the employee, no apology and only one option was given for a new flight which was the following day with a layover making my direct flight into a much longer trip. I asked if Southwest was offering any compensation to their customers for hotel accommodations and the answer was “the weather in Milwaukee was going to get really bad and by the time the flight would get there, the airport would be closed, so no, they don’t compensate for weather”. That statement was false. I live in Milwaukee and no rain or storms were in the forecast. I left the counter not feeling valued as a customer. In customer service, how you handle a difficult situation is where you gain loyalty. Not one of those 50 customers walked away feeling valued or that anyone was doing all they could to help. I understand a regional airline like Southwest doesn’t have as many flights as the other airlines to try and help people, but they could have shown empathy, be apologetic, offered some type of compensation even if it was a voucher for their airline. But we were all just a number in a line.

"Not Verified |  Baltimore to Fort Lauderdale. I have flown with this airline several times and have only come back for the low prices. The ground customer service is terrible. The people tell you different things, are often confused, and have a bad attitude. Both times i’ve flown southwest recently the plane has been overbooked and they also forced people with 2 carryons to check one, even though you are allowed to check two. The seats aren’t awful but they aren’t very comfortable either. Both time we have checked in practically right at the 24 hour mark when you are allowed to but we still end up in C class. It’s incredibly frustrating because I flew with my daughter who is 10. We were told there would be no problem getting us a seat together but when we got on not only were there no seats together but there was only middle seats left. She was really upset and scared to sit between two strangers. The pick your own seat just isn’t a good system in my opinion, it’s chaotic when you get on a plane, and stressful to find a seat. The on flight wifi is really low quality. The plane staff is fine but they in no way go out of their way to be helpful. I am overall very dissatisfied with my experience with Southwest and I will absolutely never fly with them again and unless you are a single flyer I urge you to choose a different airline too.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely ridiculous customer service. Don’t fly Southwest Airlines. Remember, you get what you pay for. If there are any issues that would require customer service assistance from this airline your done for. The nightmare initially begun on the 17th of July when I was scheduled to depart from St. Louis to arrive in Norfolk, VA. Arrive at the Southwest ticketing counter to learn my flight had been cancelled due to weather. Once I learned this, I asked the ticketing agent isn’t it protocol for someone to call, text, or email me the customer, to make them aware of the flight changes. The reply I got was priceless. Basically, my question was ignored. So, now the ticketing agent begins to look in order to rebook my flight. Now, they book me a flight for the very next morning. However, this time I will have to fly from St Louis to Cleveland, OH, then to Chicago, Illinois and then onto a Norfolk. Of course, I accept the reservation thinking all has been resolved and there would be no more issues. So approximately hours later I arrive back in St. Louis airport. I board the first flight from St. Louis thinking I’m finally on my way to my destination and I would be good to go. The plane lands arriving in Cleveland with the pilot coming on the speaker stating, “there’s a weather delay and no one can get in or out of Chicago”!  After sitting in Cleveland for almost four hours until finally being cleared for take off to continue the journey now to Chicago and then Norfolk. Finally, land in Chicago approximately three hours after my Southwest connection flight had already departed for Norfolk. I immediately go to Southwest customer service counter to explain what I just went through. First, I’m told all remaining flights are booked going to Norfolk. I’m also told that they can fly me to Baltimore, Maryland the next day, which would be the third day! And I’m also told when I get to Baltimore I would have to be on standby in order to try to get a flight to Norfolk. Now, my frustration is beginning to show. I ask if I would be provided a hotel here in Chicago and I was told no. So, I get no hotel, no later flight, and absolutely nothing at all in order to make up for this inconvenience. Not even a bag of peanuts or even a drink. I always knew this was a suspect airline. However, take it from me. Save your money and go United or Delta. If you don’t and something happens. In my case weather!!! Then, your just throwing your money away. I understand weather is not the airlines fault. However, it’s how the customer service takes care of their customers during that inconvenience is what is being measured. I’m a customer who definitely learns from their mistakes. In short, no one should have to experience this, especially in a strange unfamiliar city and then get told that the best they can do is have me sleep on the floor in the airport and then ride to

"Not Verified |  I am very disappointed in Southwest’s customer service. I booked a flight back in March and just discovered 2 days before my flight that they completely changed my itinerary without notification. I originally selected a 1pm flight out of Atlanta because I live 2 hours away from any airport and they are the closest. So, instead of waking up at 8am and leaving by 9 to make it to the airport at 11am. I now have to wake up at 4am to battle rush hour traffic and get 3 small children through the airport. There is reason I needed that flight time. Any later flights and I am looking at getting at my destination around 10pm-11pm and then Driving another 1.5 hours to get to my destination. When I called to see what could be done the corporate office pretty much told me it wasn’t their problem and there was nothing they could do. I asked if they could get my family a hotel room the night before, after spending thousands on tickets to book a flight you think they could throw me bone, but they said they would not and that again this wasn’t their problem.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Charleston to Cleveland via Baltimore. After hearing great things about Southwest Airlines I booked a trip with higher expectations. The cost was reasonable and the fact that you could take two bags was awesome! It was my 4 month olds first time flying and I thought because the reviews were grand we would be just fine on this flight even though there was a connecting flight and layover on both round trip flights. I was very disappointed when we deplaned and were informed that our next flight would be delayed due to the air conditioning on the aircraft going out. What started out as a 30 minute delay became a 3 hour delay with a switch of aircraft. What’s worse? The aircraft we were switched to turned out to be having maintenance issues also.

"Not Verified |  Tampa to Kansas City. I know better than to choose Southwest, but somehow I did. The customer service was horrid. My 11 year old son was flying by himself. He checked no bags. The ticketing agent wouldn’t let me go with him over to the plane and help him make sure he knew where to go. She also wouldn’t let me use my KTN for him to go through TSA Pre, though when I travel with him on other airlines he gets to go through TSA Pre because I do. He’s too young and isn’t eligible for TSA Pre yet. The ticketing agent was rude and weirdly aggressive. I’m definitely never flying this joke of an airline again. If it were just me I’d have no issue, but to do this to an 11 year old is unconscionable. Especially when it was so busy and my son already was nervous and confused.

"Not Verified |  Minneapolis to Cancun via Chicago-Midway. After having a flawless flight to Cancun I was shocked at how things were so bad trying to get back to MSP. After leaving Cancun and told we were going to land in Chicago-we circled Chicago for over 20 min because of bad weather. Then told we were running low on fuel-we had to land in St. Louis to refuel. Then waiting on paperwork...we were finally ready to head back to Chicago. After landing in Chicago we were told we had to stay on the plane for an hour because we were not near customs. After 15 min we were able to get off the plane and get through customs and get our luggage. After all of that delay and when we got to a Southwest agent-he told us the next flight back to MSP would take us BACK to St. Louis and then to Ohio and end in MSP!  No Way! So the Southwest agent said, “If you think you can make your flight-go ahead and try!” So I booked it through security with many nice people letting me go ahead of them and starting at B1...I RAN to B26. Sweating and panting I made it to my gate with many “C” people still waiting to board. Hooray! (I was an “A” person.) I gave the ticketing agent my ticket and he called someone and said, “She has a ticket, but she is not coming up.” Then asked me to speak with a gate agent. WELL- MY SEAT HAD BEEN GIVEN AWAY SINCE NO ONE THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE THE FLIGHT!!! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT??? With many people STILL waiting to board! Just unreal! They would do NOTHING for me but tell me I had a 9:50pm flight as my only option! Then they tell me I’m the last seat! A “C”-not an “A” like I was last time! Even though I asked if I could “please” get on earlier! No one was helpful at all-such a shame to leave our resort in Mexico where everyone was kind and helped in any way they could!

"✅ Trip Verified |  Little Rock to Ontario via Phoenix. This was the worse flight of my life. There were 2 claim to be service animals on my flight. 1 of the dogs seem to really be a service animal because it was very chilled and quiet. The other was barking, jumping on people, the owner even let it loose on the plane doing the flight. Prior to boarding I witness this dog doing all of this, so when I was boarding it was hanging out into the middle of the isle, I asked the flight attendant if he could ask the owner to please hold the dog so I could board, I have extremely high anxiety and fear of dogs. He rudely said no, i'm not its a service dog. I said I understand but I have a disability also and I need to board. He rudely said, I am not going to tell another person how or what to do with their dog. A few people on the flight heard him and said Miss, let me help you and blocked the dog so I could get by. Shortly after plane took off, the dog was loose on the plane, a female flight attendant told the owner he would have to keep the dog with him.  I don't have a problem with people that need and/or require service animals, but I do think they should be made to control their animal.

"Not Verified |  I regretfully feel obligated to report my experience this previous weekend 6/22 regarding Southwest Airlines and their Southwest Vacations. I have been a loyal supporter of Southwest for over 15 years, and have had nothing but superior customer service and great experiences until this unfortunate event. I went to Southwest as I always do and decided to use their Southwest Vacations options since I was staying at a hotel this trip. Everything was fine, or so I thought, untill 6/22 my scheduled departure date. I go online to check in to my flight only to find out that my flight has been cancelled without notification to me. Surprised I call Southwest and try to understand what has happened. After about 2 hours on hold I was told that my flight was cancelled due to weather and that I had unknowingly booked through a 3rd party and not Southwest themselves, despite using the Southwest official website to book. After a 20 minute conversation I was forced to leave the following day as there were no flights remaining that day (unless I could get to the gate within 10 minutes), causing me to miss previously scheduled and paid for events that could not be made up or refunded. I then call the hotel and try to cancel my room since I will not be staying there and they said that since I booked though Southwest Vacations, they had to cancel the room and refund me. Did not seem like an issue. Fast forward to today, 6/27. I finally am back and get to speak with customer relations from Southwest. Thinking that this should not be much of an issue as they had miscommunication on their end, they could refund me for the nights stay that I would miss as they called and cancelled the night with the hotel, and would be able to compensate me in some manor for the error of not contacting me to allow me to get on a different flight earlier that day that had availability, and some possible compensation for the events that were missed. During the conversation with the agent for Southwest, she specifically said that ""They would take responibility"" for the error as Southwest Vacations is subcontracted though a 3rd party administrator. Even though it bears the offical Southwest logo, is accessed though their Official website, they contract out that to another party, but she still stated ""they would (were taking) take responsibility"" I think, great we can get this taken care of, to only have Southwest offer me a $50 voucher. $50 to cover 3 missed events, a premium room on Saturday night in Las Vegas, and a lost day of my vacation. This is 100% unacceptable as they themselves took responsibility for the error and still refused to at the very least refund me the money for the hotel room that was never used and some gesture for the error. I can not believe that Southwest who allows their logo and namesake to be used to mislead loyal customers into using something that they promote on their website, but then do not stand behind even though it holds their name is despicable. I felt disrespected as a loyal customer to be offered $50 for what was a loss of 20 times that amount.

"✅ Trip Verified |  New Orleans to San Francisco via San Diego. Where do I begin? This is our first time flying Southwest since August of 2018 and to fully explain my frustration with their customer service I’ll have to start with the story of them cancelling both of our flights and leaving us with no other option than for us to pay 1.2k each for tickets back home in order to catch our out of country flight the next day. We are both wedding photographers and were leaving New Orleans to head to Baltimore for a wedding. The morning of our flight, about two hours prior, we received a notification from Southwest Airlines that our flight was cancelled. They provided us with alternative flight options, which we selected and then put us on standby (without communicating this with us). Fast forward, after a 10+ hour travel day we made it to Baltimore a little after midnight. Keep in mind the direct flight is normally 2.5 hours.  The morning of our returning flight from Baltimore to New Orleans we received yet another cancellation notification. However, this time the link to their flight change wasn’t working, no flights were available to select and the help call line to book another flight had a wait time of 2-3 hours. And so I waited, because we didn’t really have any other option. And each time they picked up the call they disconnected us, leaving us with literally zero alternative flight options or any way to get in touch with Southwest Airlines. This charade continued on until 4pm in the afternoon, no contact from southwest, no alternative flights, they straight up cancelled our flights and gave us nothing in return. Because we were leaving the country the next day we had no other choice than to pay 1.2k for a ticket out of Baltimore. Southwest Airlines finally got in touch with us a few days later, not acknowledging any lack in their system, pretending as though the day of our cancelled departure never happened. They offered us a $75 voucher for our trouble. What. A. Joke. Now a year later in hopes that southwest has their stuff together, we’ve boarded our plane from New Orleans only for them to tell us an engine failed to stay on. They asked us to switch planes, no biggie. This stuff happens. Two hours later and we’re finally boarding the next plane. We miss our connecting flight in San Diego due to their delay and end up waiting another two hours for our next flight. They call us to the front desk to adjust our tickets (A group, what’s up - yes, we were quick, we were prepared!) and they had us boarding at the back of the plane. I kid you not. They not only delayed us by 4+ hours but they didn’t even have the courtesy of taking care of us by allowing us to board in our original position, or even during pre-boarding. Come on southwest, we were loyal before you repeatedly screwed us over. So while, Southwest is great with their checked bags, and while it’s awesome that you can be flexible with them, remember there’s a massive chance they’ll cancel your flight and leave you having to spend a couple grand on a new flight and then pretend that never happened.",Business,Economy Class,Oakland to Seattle,June 2019,no,    new orleans to san francisco via san diego where do i begin this

"✅ Trip Verified |  El Paso to Oklahoma via Dallas. What happened to all those employees who help in time of need? There were kids on the ground exhausted, people in distress by the boat load. You guys are so quick to tell good stories and how your employees help. They all went home to bed, the few that were there I could tell were bothered by the chaos and had no answers for anyone. There was one employee walking down the long line of people. I thought finally someone to help give us an update. No she was just trying to figure out why so many hundreds of people were in line at such a late hour. I guess if I didn’t start recruiting people at midnight to help find a taxi, UBER or Lyft to Oklahoma I would have slept on the floor and I think your staff would have left thinking that seems wild. It felt like we were treated just like that a wild animal who didn’t belong in the airport. Left @ 12:30pm from El Paso Texas Flight delayed while on plane 655pm due to fuel gauge?  The ramp got stuck and there was an electrical problem. Still stuck on the plane.

"Not Verified |  Minneapolis to Sacramento via Denver. Worst flight and customer service experience ever experienced. I can understand that weather is out of their control but it’s how the flight changes were dealt with and poor customer service received that prompted this review. We were flying from Minneapolis-St. Paul to Sacramento on a Sunday over Memorial Day weekend. Unfortunately there was a layover in Denver and we missed the connecting flight. Automatically rebooked the flight to the following evening and they did not offer any accommodations. Also, because we were put on standby for the earliest flight the next day their system removed us from the confirmed flight the following day even though we were fifth in line for standby. They did not tell us this ahead of time and we slept in the airport because we would’ve paid $150 for 4 hrs of sleep since we would have to go thru security once more in the morning. When we did not make the cut for the following morning flight the later evening flight no longer had spots available.

"Not Verified |  Good afternoon. I wanted to take a minute to say thank you and share with you why you have converted me from another airline for life. My wife’s Grandmother was in her last days and hours of her life, the last week of March this year. My wife and I had planned on traveling to see her and had a ticket purchased already for my wife and one of my daughters, but we needed it changed and needed to get me and my other daughter a flight. For my work, I travel quite frequently from Nashville to Dallas among other places on another airline. Because of my status I like them to continue to build points with them. I called them first to book myself and my daughter a flight to Phoenix. They were of no assistance, would not budge on the price for an emergency, and would still charge me a large amount to move my points. I hung up. My wife then called Southwest. Not only did they get us booked last minute, they adjusted the pricing for an emergency, and helped us the whole way thru it moving our points around etc.. Even when we got to the airport, they bumped us to an even earlier flight to get us there as quickly as possible. What a blessing it was to fly with you. If we would have gone with the other airline, or had we not been bumped up to an earlier flight, we would not have made it in time to see her grandmother before she passed. We arrived within less than 2 hours of her passing. What you do for people every day may seem routine, but for us, it was a life changing moment. Having my wife be there before her grandmother passed means more to me than I can possibly express to you. As a result, I have decided to switch to Southwest for all of my work and personal trips going forward even though I do not have status with you. Sometimes I fly out of Knoxville where you do not service, but other than that, I will forever use you now.

Austin to Houston. This trip which ended in Alabama was the most horrible experience I’ve had in all the years of traveling first the company that I went to work for chose the least expensive way to get me to the location. When I boarded the plane I was wearing a leather jacket that was owned by my stepfather who had passed away it was handed down to me for years. I had admired this jacket and I decided to take it with me for good luck at my sales event however it was rather bulky so when I got on the plane they were full and the airline stewardess asked if I would put the jacket in the above head storage. I’ve heard horror stories of arguing with a flight attendant and have seen too many movies so I complied and put it in the overhead bin. However I did not realize of the seating arrangements which is open seating when you get on the plane so the only seats that were available were the center seats which left me at a disadvantage where I couldn’t see the overhead bin that my jacket was it So when we landed I had to wait for everyone to move in order to get out of my seat and by the time I got to the bin where my jacket was to be it was gone I of course did not get upset because again did not want to be escorted off the plane so I asked as I got off about my jacket they said they would check on it once I get off. I waited about 15 minutes or so no one came out finally someone came out and said they could not find my jacket and that I would have to report it online because they had no one there to take the report which I thought was odd as a customer service gesture. When I finally spoke to them they told me that I need to report it online, after I done so all I heard from them is we haven’t found it we haven’t found it to this day. I have not heard from them again it’s as if they don’t care what happens to your belongings and they have no sense of responsibility how sad for the general public",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to San Diego,October 2018,no,"

"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to Oakland. Southwest cancelled our flight going and coming home. Instead of trying to help their customers they just leave them without options. Within minutes every flight was sold out. When they cancelled our flight flying out, I called and the customer service rep said my flight coming home would not be cancelled. It was and I was not able to get another flight for two days which was not possible due to a connecting flight. We had to go with another airline that could accommodate us. It cost allot of extra money and time. Southwest could have cared less. Then when I had to cancel the flight I booked two days later after I asked if I would get a full refund if I could get another flight, they tried to charge me anyway. It is unbelievable the lack of customer service they have provided this trip. I’m not understanding why they couldn’t just get another plane to put all of these customers on and leave them where they are rather than just leave them with nothing to fin for themselves. As of now I am considering never flying with them again and cutting my southwest card up. They never once tried to make the situation better.

I just wanted to share my recent experience with Southwest so that people can make informed decisions and know what they are getting themselves into when they book with them. I did not have a good experience with Southwest Airlines. I received an email from Southwest on Wednesday night indicating that my Thursday morning flight back from Boston to Denver had been cancelled due to weather. I had heard from my brother-in-law, who used to fly Southwest frequently, that they had a very strict weather cancellation policy, so out of curiosity, I went to check if all flights into Denver were cancelled, or if Southwest was just falling back on their strict weather cancellation policy. I found that both JetBlue and Spirit flights were still scheduled to arrive in Denver on time, which would lead me to believe that although Denver airport conditions may not have been ideal, they were safe enough for commercial airlines to fly in. Denver International Airport was even indicating that they had 4 of their 6 runways open. I called the number Southwest included in their flight cancellation email to reschedule my flight. After waiting on hold for about 1.5 hours, I was disconnected, so I called them back immediately only to wait on hold for 2 more hours. Once I was finally able to get through to a customer service representative to reschedule my flight, the representative told me that the absolute soonest flight they could get me on was not until Sunday, 4 days later. My husband and I had plans to go up to the mountains for the weekend and flying back into Denver on Sunday would have caused us to miss our entire trip. So I called AMEX Travel, as I had booked through them initially, and they were able to get me on a United flight leaving Saturday…one day earlier than the Southwest flight. At this point I was really wishing I would have booked with JetBlue or Spirit, as now I would be stuck in Boston an additional 3 days that I had not planned for. This means 3 more nights in a hotel, 3 more days of having to purchase food, and 3 more days of missing work. If this wasn’t inconvenient enough, my husband and I were also not going to be able to make our trip to the mountains, which we had already planned. Just for fun, I added up all the costs that stemmed from Southwest cancelling my flight. Hotel: $150/per night x 3 nights = $450 (prices had gone up over the weekend due to the St. Patrick’s Day holiday) Food: about $10/meal x 9 meals = $90 Missed days of work: $22/hr x 24 hrs (3 8 hr workdays) = $528. Total amount lost due to Southwest cancelling my flight because of their “strict weather policy” = $1,068 (this is not including the money that was already spent on our trip to the mountains that we were not able to take). I don’t know many people who can afford to just lose out on that amount of money. Southwest did end up refunding my cancelled flight, which naturally they should, considering they cancelled it. In addition, when I called in to see if they could offer any other kind of compensation, they offered me a $150 Southwest flight voucher. They indicated that because the flight was cancelled due to weather, the cancellation was out of their control and is not their fault. I beg to differ. JetBlue and Spirit did not cancel their flights, so clearly, the cancellation was due to some policy Southwest has that JetBlue and Spirit do not.,",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Punta Cana to Baltimore,March 2019,no,"

"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a change of last name that I e-mailed well back in Jan 2019. Upon requesting how to get my last name change, I was not informed that I should also include any upcoming flight reservation numbers. That being said, only my Rapid Rewards profile was updated on the site, nothing else. I didn't know what to make of this by the time I went to fly out. I was allowed to fly with my old married last name with no issues, but was almost left to not be allowed to get on the plane from Austin because my ID didn't match my boarding pass name. This caused me to nearly miss my flight and I rushed to the gate losing 4 items!  I've never in my life lost so many items in my life- especially not all at once! I was incredibly flustered. I lost 2 items at Austin, one on a plane going to Nashville, then at the Nashville Airport before boarding my flight back to Chicago. The incorrect last name was Baker instead of Anderson. I called to their Customer Service headquarters to where the best they could do was offer me a voucher of $100. That's not even enough for a free flight (round trip) to anywhere! They seriously don't care about their customers because aside from using this voucher, I will no longer be using their flight services again. I didn't even get a promised drink from Nashville into Chicago. I also landed without a jacket (because this was one of my 4 lost items) and ended up freezing. I've reported my lost items twice! TWICE! Because after you call in to report a claim of a lost item, they insist that you fill out a document of theirs to be submitted via e-mail on top of it. This company makes all sorts of excuses as to why they won't do anything further. They say that they had no idea I had an upcoming flight based on my RR#. I had no idea they even needed it! So, they can't point blame on me. What happened to the ""Customer's always right!"" attitude? I'll be taking my business elsewhere and I recommend everyone else does the same! I get that they are not responsible for lost items; however, I would not have lost any of those items if I hadn't been flustered to missing my plane to begin with- so yes, it is their fault when I've never lost anything at airports in my life!

✅ Trip Verified |  Baltimore to Tampa. I had surgery 6 days prior and had medical documentation stating I was not to lift anything over 2 pounds or walk extended distances. I was not even supposed to fly but I was going to see a specialist on Maryland so the restrictions were put in place and we arranged wheelchair assistance. I had zero issues the flight to BWI. The trip back was an absolute nightmare and completely unacceptable. We landed in Tampa after a turbulent flight which in turn heightened my pain. I was 1 of 5 people that had boarded with wheelchair assistance. When we landed we were advised that the wheelchairs weren't available yet. Fortunately the other 4 people were able to walk off the aircraft without a problem. I advised the stewardess of my restrictions and stated I would wait. Everyone had gotten off and the stewardess asked me to walk off. I again told her I could not. They cleaned the plane a bit and again told me I needed to get off. I did not fight it and advised them I could not lift my bag and they carried it off for me and had me stand in pain in the alleyway and wait with the entire crew. She then said I needed to go so I slowly started walking and walked most the alley way where I was then greeted with a wheelchair. The attendant then took off hitting the bump off the gate. I told him I just had surgery but clearly he was in a hurry. This is absolutely unacceptable. I legitimately needed help and had arranged for assistance on advance with documentation stating my restrictions. If there weren't any wheelchairs available I should not have been forced to walk in pain when I was advised by a medical professional otherwise. I had physical proof with me and this trip was not made by choice. I called and filed a complaint with customer service and was advised I would get a response within 10 days. This is unacceptable!

I checked myself in and again brought it up to the gate agent and customer service - again, just a shrug and ""weird"". No apology. No refund offer. Nothing. It's very confusing to me, because Southwest has amazing customer service in all other avenues in my experience. But with early bird check in, they just don't care if it works or not.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Hartford to Tampa. The fact that we were significantly delayed tonight by 2 hr. 40 min. isn't even the motivation behind this review. It's not even the constant WiFi problems we experience every single flight. The main reason is Southwest's lack of heart. I was A-List Preferred and have flown SW exclusively for a few years now. I was three flights short in 2018 to maintain my A-List Preferred status, and I emailed them explaining that the reason I was short was because I was forced to fly Delta a few times due to Southwest cancelling or delaying the flights in question. It was such a light-hearted plea, too. I thought surely in the name of customer experience, they'll understand and appreciate the fact that I'm loyal to them still and they'll do the right thing. Not so much, unfortunately. Instead, I get this canned email response below. ""We received your email and appreciate your taking the time to contact us. As a valued Customer of Southwest Airlines, your feedback is very important to us, and we welcome the opportunity to respond. A-List and A-List Preferred status provides lucrative benefits to recognize and reward our most loyal Customers, and we must rely on our Rapid Rewards Members to gain entry to these tier levels through their activity in the program. I truly understand your frustration given that you were only three flights shy of qualifying for A-List Preferred. In order to maintain the integrity of our Rapid Rewards program and continue to provide the perks associated with each tier status, we must consistently adhere to the program rules. Saying “no” to a request for tier status that has not been truly earned helps ensure that we are able to say “yes” to offering benefits to our qualifying Members in the future.

If he was going home I was going to ask to sit next to him to help with my fears. He was the flying pilot. He asked me if everything was ok and I told him I was very scared and nervous. He told me it was going to be ok and a smooth short ride. I thanked him for the conversation and went to wait in line to board. Well a few mins into waiting a wonderful man came and said to come with him. They allowed me on the plane and introduced me to everyone working on the plane. The wonderful gentlemen told me to pick any seat and he would sit next to me and guide me through the sounds and bumps so I know I’m safe. Everyone working on flight 1599 was so amazing.

When my fiance and I go to sit down we are told those seats are being saved for someone else's family members. Obviously those family members did not get up to get a higher boarding number. When I asked the stewardess if that was allowed the stewardess replied we don't regulate the seating. Needless to say my fiance and I we're separated during a very long flight. Also we ordered drinks and the stewardesses sat in the back giggling and laughing with each other rather than doing their job we didn't get our drinks until we had to ask them not once but twice.

"✅ Trip Verified |  El Paso to San Antonio. So if you ask for assistance lifting your bag over your head you cannot sit in the emergency exit row. I am a law student and figured I’d add the heavy books to my luggage over the backpack. Well I should have checked my bag because when I asked for a boost to push the bag in the flight attendant first said she had a hurt shoulder and couldn’t do much to assist. She gave it a light push. Then when the bag was up she said if I couldn’t lift my bag over my head I couldn’t sit in the emergency exit row. The 70 year old man with the tiny bag could, but I could not. The elderly couple (the wife could not lift her own bag but her husband lifted it for her) could sit in the emergency exit row. Last time I sat in that row a former pilot assisted me in putting up my bag and did not flag down a flight attendant or even mention that if I could not lift my bag I can’t sit there. The flight attendant could not lift my bag, yet she is still able to work and presumably can open the door. Further, the guests in the emergency exit row were drinking cocktails. Intoxication seems to render them fit. I have already addressed this issue with Southwest on Twitter and they do not seem to care.

"Not Verified |  Originally going from Grand Rapids to Birmingham,  through Chicago Midway. The GR flight was delayed 3 hours so I would miss my connection. I asked customer service if I could drive to midway and catch the connection. They said no that was not possible to do, but would rebook me on a different flight. I drove to midway for the rebooked flight to find that it too was delayed by more than 3 hrs and would miss my connection in Tampa. So they rebooked me on the second leg of the original flight (the one customer service said was not possible to get on).

It was also my 8 year old son’s first flight from STL to Denver and we were all so nervous. It was an extremely early flight, 5:30am departure. When we first boarded, the pilot was standing in the aisle and introduced himself to my son. We told them it was our very first flight ever and he could see that my son was in tears. After introducing himself he told my son that he will safely get us there and will make sure it’s a wonderful flight so he will love flying, so do not worry about a thing, and even showed my son the cockpit area, it made his day, week, year. They also gave him a little airplane sticker pin. We hit a little bit of turbulence on the way however the pilot told us every single time prior to possibly hitting it and even explained why and that it was perfectly safe and how long the turbulence might last. It made us all so comfortable. I have flown at least 20 flights just since then and have yet to have a bad experience with Southwest.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Houston to Norfolk via Baltimore. I flew out of Houston, TX to Norfolk, VA on 5Oct and was to return on 12Oct. My Daughter's 2nd Birthday was on the 7th of Oct. I went to the gate on the 5th for my departure, nothing was said about having to pay for my daughter's return flight because she was ""2"" now. I go to the airport to depart and was rudely told I need to pay for her ticket, and that the information is on the website - and that she is ""Sorry I didn't read it"". I would assume being in customer service and knowing the regulations that it would have still been told to me when looking at my daughter's Birth Certificate and seeing she turns two within the time of my stay in VA. I called the airline and they told me that I have no choice but to pay $243.80 for my daughter to fly back. I didn't anticipate the money and didn't have it. I had to miss my flight, and go back to a friends house that I stayed with. I didn't have a rental car anymore because I had to turn it in, so I had to wait for someone to come & get my daughter and I. After I got to my friends house I called and spoke withthe Customer Relations Dept and she said she was sorry about my situation and that I could apply for a donation ticket back. I went to the website and read that SWA gives away 40,000 free tickets a year to ""those in need"" but the request can take 6-8 weeks. I have a job I had to get back to, didnt have enough diapers, or anything to continue my stay. So, I called them back. Again, ""I am sorry, but there is no way around it- you'll have to pay"". I told the agent I can pay on the 19th, but will it still be the same amount of money for my daughter to fly back, and how much will it cost to change my reservations. She said they can't guarantee the price will be the same, and that she didn't know how much more out of pocket I would have to come out. I live paycheck to paycheck. I only went to VA because my oldest daughter gave birth to my first Grandchild, and it was important I would be there. I could have left my daughter with my Husband while I was gone if I would have known I had to pay for her return flight back. But since I was stuck there, no one cared and upper management that could have helped me, and also didnt want to get on the phone themselves did not help, nor care I was stranded without a vehicle and no place to go with my 2 year old daughter. I was fortunate enough to reach out to distant family and borrow the money to fly back home with my baby.

At this time it would have been nice if she had mentioned the baby needed a boarding pass. Since he was a lap child I did not know that he needed a boarding pass until I got to the gate to board. I then had to get out of the line to get the babies boarding pass printed. Is it a huge deal no but the customer service industry needs to anticipate and serve the customer. This just leads me to believe they don’t care about customer service. While I was dealing with this issue the ladies printing the boarding pass pointed out out how that was someone else’s job. After I got the boarding pass I went to board the plane and gave my car seat. I was then told it needed a tag and I was asked why I didn’t get a tag as I was getting the baby’s boarding pass. As if it were my fault. The customer service is just poor. I have several other examples and they of course seem small.,Business,Economy Class,Chicago to Newark,September 2018,no,    denver to phoenix delays and incompetent staff southwest could benefit from teaching all of their employees to take responsibility regardless of whos job certain things actually are for example i entered the airport with an 18 month old i asked the woman checking us in if i could check the car seat at that time she said no and to check it at the gate at this time it would have been nice if she had mentioned the baby needed a boarding pass since he was a lap child i did not know that he needed a boarding pass until i got to the gate to board i then had to get out of the line to get the babies boarding pass printed is it a huge deal no but the customer service industry needs to anticipate and serve the customer this just leads me to believe they dont care about customer service while i was dealing with this issue the ladies printing the boarding pass pointed out out how that was someone elses job after i got the boarding pass i went to board the plane and gave my car seat i was then told it needed a tag and i was asked why i didnt get a tag as i was getting the babys boarding pass as if it were my fault the customer service is just poor i have several other examples and they of course seem small,denver phoenix delays incompetent staff southwest could benefit teaching employees take responsibility regardless whos job certain things actually example entered airport 18 month old asked woman checking us could check car seat time said check gate time would nice mentioned baby needed boarding pass since lap child know needed boarding pass got gate board get line get babies boarding pass printed huge deal customer service industry needs anticipate serve customer leads believe dont care customer service dealing issue ladies printing boarding pass pointed someone elses job got boarding pass went board plane gave car seat told needed tag asked didnt get tag getting babys boarding pass fault customer service poor several examples course seem small,NEG

"Not Verified |  Orlando to Las Vegas. Southwest is being money hungry and also dismissive to concerns on program and pricing changes. And they used a bait and switch method. I booked my flights some time ago and was offered the early bird check in option at an additional cost of $60 RT for my wife and I. I went back to book it and now the price is $100. When I called, I was told that the program changed at the end of August. Mind you the $60 is already a fee to get checked in early so you have a better boarding group time so you can rush on and pick your seats. The other airlines allow you to select a seat at booking so you do not have to get on the plane searching for your seat and beat out someone else like it is the last bottle of water before a hurricane. I would have saved money going with another carrier and not had to pay for the privilege of getting a better line up position to then still have to search for two seats together where we would like to sit. I talked to a few lower level staff that agreed with me that I should be able to get the original rate I was quoted at the time of booking. However, they could not help me. They did say they are getting similar feedback and it is not going over well. I called corporate at their direction and that got worse. The person at corporate was unapologetic and cold professional. She informed me that basically it is an ancillary rate and they have the right to change it at any time. She did understand my point about being offered a price on an already booked flight but was unwilling to do anything to assist. She then said they notified people by placing a disclaimer on their site for 8 days at the end of August. I had already purchased my ticket and have the app so had no reason to go back on the site. No email or reaching out to someone that already purchased. So they took what was already a junk fee for something no one else charges for and increased it to make more profit. She said well at the lower cost too many people were using it so it was not really an advantage to those buying it. And based on that feedback they felt raising the price to reduce the number of people purchasing it would make it more valuable for those buying it. I mean they could have just limited it to the first 50 people that purchase it or something like that. So buy early and get the advantage. That is how the best seat assignments work on other airlines. Instead they would thin the heard by raising the price and pricing people out in order to make it a better experience for those that can and are willing to pay. It is a greedy money grab. They sell themselves as different, and better and “we got rid of assigned seats and tickets to make fares lower.” But really it just is good marketing because they intend to get it from you on the backend. In all actuality I could have gone with another airline and saved and had seat assignments and not had to pay an extra fee. And this day and age no longer do they really have to print that many paper tickets with tickets on phone apps. At the end of the conversation I recapped that they offered a price on a confirmed booking and then changed it later without due diligence notification. I informed her that it was a bait and switch and also poor form for such a respected company. It was underhanded and not appreciated and was just raising what was already a junk fee.

Not Verified |  We were flying from Atlanta to Milwaukee for my sister in laws wedding. Our flight was scheduled to stop in Baltimore then continue to Milwaukee. We hit a storm and understandably we were delayed. We had to stop in DC because we needed fuel and Baltimore was temporarily closed. Upon arriving at DC we were just waiting for fuel. That then turned into waiting over an hour for new pilots. During this entire time we were never notified of delay times or that the Milwaukee flight was cancelled. We finally arrived in Baltimore at 1 am and were told our flight was canceled and they rescheduled us for the morning. We went to a counter to get our boarding pass and to figure out overnight reservations. Southwest would not pay for the hotel accommodations and told us to sleep at the airport or pay for a hotel ourselves. They also couldn’t even upgrade our boarding and we are stuck boarding very last. Overall very disappointed with how Southwest handled the situation.

"✅ Trip Verified |  La Guardia to Indianapolis. I received no call, text or email regarding my flight cancellation. After I got through to security I pulled up my boarding pass to check where to go but the information was not updated. The screens with gate information were all off and not knowing where to go  I stood in line to a flight that could have potentially gotten me home hoping there may be room on it because tickets were still being sold online for it. I stood in line and the lady was rude and told me to go to a different line and that she can't help me; I explained where i need to go, that I've not gotten any communication about cancellation, that I've been waiting to figure out what's going on and they said the flight I tried to get was booked. I asked why it is allowing me to purchase a ticket online and they just shoved me to a different gate where i was on line for even longer. Due to no communication of even alerting me that the flight was cancelled via email or text, how dismissive the lady at the first gate was, having to wait additional time, contradictory information about the flight being booked, i was experiencing anxiety. There was not a single person who expressed any empathy in form of ""sorry"" or ""let me see what we can do"" - no one cared. I was told the flight will be tomorrow. I told them if i pay for the ticket boarding right next door - can i get on that flight or will I have trouble. And they kept saying i cannot book that flight even though the site was asking me to input credit card info for that same ticket. I just asked for a refund and booked a flight with a different airline.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Denver to Orlando. I made a mistake when preparing for my flight. I did not check if hiking poles were allowed on aircraft. They did not fit in either of my two free checked bags. Therefore. I attached them to my personal backpack to carry on the plane. I was stopped at the TSA security checkpoint and was told I was not allowed to bring them. They were expensive and I didn't want to forfeit them to TSA. My two previous checked bags had already been taken away for loading. I had pay $75 to check my personal backpack (being my 3rd checked bag). After purchasing the extra bag, I approached the check in counter. The Southwest employee told me that because the poles were not  sealed in the bag (they stuck out of the top) there was a good possibility they would be lost and Southwest airlines would not be responsible for replacing them. I had not choice, but the take a chance. I secured them as best I could. The employee did not give me a luggage ticket, ensuring the airline would not be liable. After a nail biting 3 hour flight, I waited anxiously at baggage claim. Sure enough all three of my bags came through. The poles had separated from my personal backpack, but someone had secured them to my larger suitcase.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Phoenix to Washington via Atlanta. Southwest Airlines flight attendants are friendly, down to earth, professional and the aircraft is comfortable. There was a weather delay however the electronic updates were very user friendly and kept me well informed of my flight status. I like Southwest Airlines because they invest in modern technology not just for the aircraft but you are able to use the internet, also when boarding there are electronic/modern technology used. The attendant announces the boarding class and seat (which sometimes it is hard to hear in the airport or due to the person speaking) but South West electronic devices for the lines alerts with the seat or boarding zone so you can visually read it which is good for people who maybe hearing impaired. Also the flight attendants uniforms are not too professional making the customers feel more at ease. Great job Southwest!

"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a flight with Southwest Airline for Sunday August 12, 2018 leaving Tampa, FL headed back home to Memphis, TN. While checking my email to ensure I had the correct gate location and departure time, I decided to check in online via Southwest website. To my surprise my flight was cancelled. I called their company at 11:00 AM and was on hold for 1 hour literally. The first lady who answered said ""yes it was cancelled but let me see if there is another flight leaving out the same day"" I responded with ""why was I not notified by email"" and she ignored me. I asked again and was told an email was sent at 9AM. I told her I check my emails around the clock and would have received a notification. She told me no flights were available for Sunday but I can leave on Monday or she can refund my money. There was no sympathy for what was just caused to me and my son. I asked to speak with a Manager and her response was ""Mam he's just going to tell you the same thing"" and I said I don't care, I need to speak with one. Well the Manager was horrible because I told them there was no way I could return Monday and that I was completely stranded and needed to get home Sunday. When I asked why was the flight cancelled he said ""the weather"" my response was ""sir I'm in Tampa and it's clear skies"" and the next thing I know I was placed instantly on hold, where I waited minutes and then the phone hung up. I called back several times with no response. I did there call back option when the sweetest woman who took her time trying to get me home on Sunday but said there was nothing else leaving out and it was too late for the one that was leaving at 4. This is how I knew there was a flight but the other two decided my faith even though I informed them of my situation. The agent found a flight and told me I could get to the airport and ask for assistance with a hotel but they don't refund money due to weather. She walked me through the flight details and I said wait let me take the information down, but she said it's coming through email. I saw the email instantly, so how ironic that hers came through but the alleged cancellation email did not. So my 1 hour no stop trip that was canceled has turned into 7 hours + with a stop in San Antonio TX, Dallas, another flight, then home from 3:30 PM -9:55 PM. No apology from Management, inconvenienced, stranded with a 12 year old, no clean clothes, no food, and no money. It's safe to say they can take off anytime without my family. This took away the joy, excitement, and turned my day into a living nightmare. For future events, a simple apology, and a notification goes a long way.

For a flight that has been already delayed you would think that someone would have done something other than leave us on the plane for approaching 30 min now.

"Not Verified |  New York to Amarillo. I was supposed to get home at 3:00 PM. I got home at 2:00 AM. However, because the day was such a disaster, I would love to add extra vilification. The day started off with a casual 4:00 wake up call since security is especially hard being in a family of 10. But, looking back, that was the only part of my day that went right at all. After arriving at the gate on time for our 6:30 AM flight, the airline promptly updated the online southwest app of an hour delay but did not inform any of us in person. An hour later, the crew announced that there were difficulties with an essential radio in the cabin. Regardless, we were all lined up and loaded into the plane anyway. But the plane never took off. Four more hours later, we waited for them to call out all of our names as a role call. However, they still pulled us all off, lined us up, and started it all over again. That flight had no further problems, but we missed both of the connecting flights. Only due to several miracle cancellations were we even able to get the two more flights to Amarillo. The second flight was from 5-6, and, aside from a couple hour layover, proceeded as planned. The third flight was scheduled, at first, to be from 10:00-11:00 PM. Then it was delayed one hour, again with the gate not informing us of the reason for or the hindrance itself. Then it was delayed another half hour. Then another. And then finally we were able to reach Amarillo. As a disclaimer, however, we were fairly compensated monetarily for the disaster.

"✅ Trip Verified |  SouthWest SMF-DAL, HOU-SEA, SEA-SMF We flew 3 legs in the USA with SouthWest and were quite impressed. All staff we had dealings with were pleasant and helpful, with the exception of a big man at kerbside check-in at Seattle who blatantly asked for a tip. That was the only negative about this efficient and professional operation. The airline offers passengers 2 checked bags for free, along with carry-on items and a discount fare for seniors. Each passenger is allocated a boarding number and must queue in order prior to boarding the plane. No seats are allocated and passengers choose where they want to sit, with the earlier on-line check- ins and business class getting a higher priority. This boarding procedure expedites the process resulting in a very rapid embarkation. The three flights we took departed and arrive on, or close to, time. On board and boarding lounge announcements varied from good, to too fast to be understood, or inaudible. The crew hand out free snacks, coffee and non-alcoholic drinks. Stronger stuff is available at a price. The seat spacing is generous compared to Australian low-cost carriers with 5 inches (13cm.) between my knees and the back of the seat in front. Interestingly, only a handful of passengers reclined their seats. All crew were friendly and some chatty making for a pleasant journey.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to La Guardia. I’ve been a loyal southwest customer for several years now, flying with them over 30 flights. They’re delays and cancellations are worse than other airlines, but I stick with them due to the no change fees. On the day before my wedding shower, they abruptly cancelled my flight via text. I scrambled to find another flight. I called, and they said it was due to maintenance and put me on a flight the following day, which wasn’t an option, so I paid an exuberant amount for a different airline, which took off within an hour of the cancelled flight (so not weather related). I rarely call for anything, even when I have severe delays due to scheduled maintenance or disorganization on southwests behalf, but this was especially frustrating so I called. The man on the phone was so condescending. He told me it was due to air traffic control and kept repeating himself when I asked for more details and for understanding. He kept interrupting me and yelled at me. He wouldn’t allow me to speak to a supervisor but then said his boss would get him in trouble for helping me out. He was so harsh and given my lack of sleep due to southwest delays, I broke into tears. Customer service has gone down, and I plan on spending my points and running as far as I can from Southwest.

"Not Verified |  Reno to Philadelphia via Chicago. Our flight was delayed in Reno by nearly 2 hours because of weather. Yes you cannot help that, but Southwest employees ensured us that our connecting flight in Chicago would hold for us and the rest of the people making this connection. Once we arrived in Chicago we found out the flight did not wait and the next flight was in the morning and were told our checked baggage would be there in the morning as well. After roaming the airport all night because we weren’t provided a hotel because it was weather related the time came to finally board our plane. Once I arrived in Philly I found out my baggage is missing. Rude customer service at the baggage claim by southwest. I also called Southwest baggage claims to see if they were able to track my bags. I was told that was coming in the future -  why are there bar codes on our luggage if they do not track it?

"✅ Trip Verified |  Providence to Orlando. Waited hour and a half before finally taxiing to take off. Then, only after we were in the air for 30 mind, they announced they forgot to mention earlier that the wifi wasn't working. The seats are ridiculously close to one another, so much so, that the tray pressed against the average adult's stomach when in the lowered position. The aisle is so narrow, even our skinny six year old daughter has difficulty walking down it facing forward. You have to shuffle sideways the entire length of the aisle. Between the aisle size and lack of space between seats, they really manage to cream as many people onboard as possible. In the bathroom, you have to hold the toilet seat in the up position, otherwise it falls down. Which makes it difficult to use the bathroom, steady yourself, and hold the seat up. The faucet of the sink sprays out so hard, it splashes onto you. Overall, it was the second worst flight I've ever been on, (and I can say with confidence that I've flown at least a hundred times on my lifetime).

"Not Verified | I fly to and from Chicago and Phoenix Az a lot since we purchased a retirement home in AZ. My mother is 85 years old and I go back and forth every month to help her with Doc appts etc, as she does not drive. I had book a roundtrip ticket to fly to Chicago for May 23, 2018 and a return flight back to Phoenix on June 16, 2018. As the time got closer my husband decided to drive to Chicago so we could stay for the summer. We have two dogs so that is why he wanted to drive. We left Phoenix on May 19th it's a 3 day drive. While on our drive I didn't want to forget to cancel the flight so I decided to do it on my cell phone. Well anyone who has a cell phone knows that when you are traveling signal is not the greatest and in some areas not at all. I tried multiple to cancel my flight on my phone but I guess due to the signal it didn't go thru. I decided to screen shot my attempt at cancelling and would try again once I was at my destination on a landline. Well I forgot. I made a mistake. While here in Illinois on the 23rd of May I received an email from Southwest stating I was a no show for my flight. I immediately got on the phone trying to explain my situation to no avail. I was told because I didn't cancel my flight It cancelled the entire reservation, which is totally not fair. I agree that they didn't have to refund my flight to Chicago, but I also lost money for the flight for June. I am a regular customer I fly Southwest a lot since 2015. I only use Southwest, I sit there and read in the magazine all these great stories, this time my story is not so great. I have tried everything possible to get this rectified and nothing. I am totally disappointed in this airline. If I could tell the world my story I would, but my advice is never book a roundtrip ticket and never try to do anything on a cell phone while traveling thru the mountains.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Southwest Airlines has always been my go-to airline, until today. I recently had to cancel a flight for my husband due to injury about 2 weeks prior to our trip. My husband rarely travels, and I paid for the trip with my credit card which gives us further travel rewards. I was offered travel funds for the cancelled trip, and since I travel all the time planned to use them for a flight for me. What Southwest fails to mention is that the person who paid for the trip is not the one that is allowed to use the funds, its only the ticketed passenger. The lady I spoke to in customer service was extremely rude and told me the policies were clearly stated on the cancellation email (I looked- they are not).

"✅ Trip Verified |  There are plenty of airline choices out there, but the past few times we have chosen Southwest because of the hospitality, great rates, and fabulous customer service. That was until today. We purchased 2 round trip tickets to go to a wedding. A couple days after booking our trip, we decided we wanted to stay a day longer, and that we would update our reservation. The website clearly stated that changing our flight would make the reservation non-refundable. It instructed that we should instead, cancel our reservation, then make a new reservation, in case anything happened and we needed to make another change. So, we cancelled the initial reservation, and booked a new one. After a couple weeks, we hadn't seen the refund for our initial purchase. I called customer service and they informed me, that apparently I had purchased a non-refundable ticket initially, and wouldn't be refunded the $650 I paid. I advised them of what the website said, they acknowledged that my understanding of the instructions ws correct, but only for ""refundable"" tickets. Nowhere did it prompt me that I was cancelling a non-refundable ticket, and it wasn't clearly stated during my purchase that these were non-refundable. The only place it was made known to me was in the confirmation email and even then, it was in black font, it was in a pale gray font at the very bottom. The customer service agent advised it wasn't refundable and couldn't help me. She transferred me to her supervisor who again stuck by the non-refundable label. it wasn't as if I cancelled altogether. I bought another reservation for $50 more! But they felt the need to hide behind their ""policy"" and not take care of a customer, who in good faith, and by instruction of the website, did what they understood they were supposed to do. Instead of help me, the agent continued to reiterate that Southwest doesn't have many policies, but this was one and I was out of luck. I told her this was unacceptable and that the right thing to do would be to honor a refund as I was still purchasing a product, and got caught up in a technicality. She apologized ""that I felt that way"" and offered me a customer service number to call instead. Southwest advertises, and prides themselves on their excellent ""customer service"", but this is a pure exploitation of a technicality and not at all the way a customer should be treated.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Orlando to Chicago. I am incredibly disappointed and disheartened by my most recent experience with Southwest Airlines. Let me preface this by saying that I have been flying Southwest for years, am an active rewards member, and currently have three upcoming trips already booked (booked before this experience). I flew out of Orlando, FL on Thursday night 5/24 at 9:15 on flight 1388 with my husband and 9 pound dog. We have flown multiple times with our dog in the past. I have always given our dog Melatonin to help her sleep while we fly (to avoid her ears popping/hurting). She was given Melatonin before boarding so she was already in her carrier as we boarded. We sat in our chosen aisle, me sitting closes to the window and my husband in the aisle seat so we could put our carry on bags in the middle seat while we got settled and I juggled two drinks. A flight attendant decided to approach us and say ""What's in the bag?"" to which my husband answered, ""a dog."" Terry then said, ""Okay, it needs to go under the seat."" No problem, we know that already so we said, ""Okay, we're just getting settled with our bags and will make sure to put her under."" He then came back I kid you not within one minute to proceed saying, ""The dog needs to go under the seat."" At this point we were getting a little upset. Once again my husband said, ""We know."" He then stayed right behind our seat while I gathered my sweater and tried putting my carry on away. I looked at my husband and mumbled, ""Gosh, can we put our seatbelts on?"" At that time, the FA very abrasively turned around, stepped into our aisle, and proceeded to yell at me saying, ""Yeah you can put your seatbelt on!"" I looked at him like a deer in headlights and said, ""Okay, I think you need to take it down."" He then stopped the rest of the passengers from boarding and continued yelling at me saying, ""Take what donw, tell me what I need to take down?"" By this point my husband and I were visibly upset. I again said, ""Take it down."" but again he continued to yell at me and say, ""I did nothing wrong!"" My husband said, ""Actually, you're yelling at us for no reason so you are wrong.""  He was the most ill behaved employee I have ever encountered in customer service. Not one single flight attendant told him to walk away nor did they try to deescalate the situation. There were people recording this. Finally he stormed off. I began crying. The entire ordeal was disrespectful, disgusting, and completely unacceptable. I pay $95 dollars each way (just like every other person who flies with their pup) so by no means was any favor done for me to have my dog accommodated for. In addition, we have flown with her numerous times and have never had such a disgraceful and distasteful experience. I called Southwest to make a complaint and was able to speak to a very nice woman who unfortunately informed me that not much would be done. This complaint would get added to his file and the incident would be used as a ""coaching"" lesson. Basically, this individual's egregious conduct was endorsed by lack of follow through.

"❌ Not Verified |  San Francisco to Raleigh Durham. This is the third vacation in 9 months where I have used Southwest and this will surely be my last. Each flight was either delayed or diverted. The first vacation flight added a stop after I had already booked my flight. The second vacation flight was diverted to Oakland instead of San Francisco. It was left to me to find a way to San Francisco for me and my family and, at my expense.

Food, hotel accomodations, and transportation to and from the hotel was left for me to figure out and to exspense. Southwest has mastered the art of telling customers that they are sorry and there is nothing they can do; and, that they do not accommodate customers for bad weather because they cannot control the weather. Furthermore, trying to get any help from customer relations and airport supervisors has proven to be useless. Finally, there should always be someone higher up to call, even on holidays and weekends.

"✅ Trip Verified |  San Francisco to Las Vegas. Southwest plays a role of a different airline as they like to pose as a company offering benefits that others don't. It's partially true, they offer 2 complimentary bags to be checked and really cool prices. But hand in hand, they also tend to plan their flights on a lowcost schedule though they staff is far from the lowcost effectiveness. That is why their 40-minute-long stops in every destination fail to be fulfilled and major delays occur, frequently. At the day of our flight, at least 50% of Southwest flights was delayed, one, two, three hours, pretty common thing apparently. The plane is a standard B737 with nothing special to tell about. The service consists of a free non-alcoholic beverage (rather small portion with a lot of ice) and a mini bag of pretzels or peanuts. The staff was OK. Plus, their open seating policy (seat wherever you want) is really a terrible thing to offer if you are not a solo traveler.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Phoenix to Chicago. My brand new bag was ruined. I literally opened the box brand new the morning before my flight. It was a birthday gift, and after my flight that evening it looked like it had been dragged behind a luggage truck for a mile across the pavement.

The plane I was on had to go to Orlando to refuel, and then back to Atlanta. We were on the plane from 2:30pm to 10:30pm, with no additional food, water, or drinks offered. Once in Atlanta, the customer service rep; re-iterated what I already knew, that we could not leave until Monday and gave us a voucher for a discount rate for a hotel. We booked the hotel (Holiday Express) in College Park, Ga, They don't take vouchers from Southwest only Delta and told us to go back to SW for a discount re-imbursement. I just finished talking to a customer rep in TX, who advises me that he could not help me with that issue and tells me how the airline is not responsible for Acts of God - I knew that, but my issue is with the hotel and the voucher.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Yesterday my husband and I had a flight from Austin to Jacksonville through Atlanta. When the flight out of Austin kept being delayed and reached 4.5 hours late because of weather in the area, we would miss the connection in Atlanta. They lady at the counter told us that meant they would cancel our fair and find an option to get us out the next day. We didn’t like that option, so we found a flight that got us to the Jax the same night through Dallas. That flight was also delayed because they were unable to track down the crew, and once boarded, we sat in line to take off. We finally took off only to be told they were not doing full service because of turbulence. All of that was unfortunate, but I understand Southwest hasn’t figured out how to control weather. When we landed in Dallas, we were told the original plan for those flying through to Jax on the same aircraft has changed and to deplane and check the monitors for our new gate. No Jacksonville flight existed out of Dallas. The flight to Jax we were supposed to be on had left hours ago! They purposefully left us behind. I quote Sean at the counter: “they ditched you to get the other people in the air.” I find this absolutely unacceptable. We should have never been allowed to come to Dallas after our flight had taken off. S The poor customer service continued has they refused to provide accommodations for us in Dallas because they blamed everything that happened on weather which they aren’t responsible for. When we pressed that sending us to Dallas was a mistake, the supervisor said it wasn’t; it was their bad weather plan. I explained again what happened in Austin - It was our plan to fly through Dallas but we were supposed to stay on our plane. And they said that they left hours ago because of weather so the mistake was because of weather. The bad day continued when we found out our bags had made it to Jax and were not in Dallas with us. So we had to find our own accommodations last night and will be rewearing our outfits as we hopefully get home on a flight to Jax today. If everything today goes according to plan, we will be landing 22 hours after we originally were.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Oakland to Orange County. Upon checking in, I received a text from them saying that our flight is having a 2 hour delay. Staff told me she doesn’t know about anything.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Denver to Chicago. Arrived at check in and received a message on the ticketing machine that the flight was cancelled due to weather in Chicago, even though my party in Chicago said there were no weather issues there, especially when I was supposed to have been landing, and every other flight continued to Chicago within a short timeframe. (Later, I checked my messages, and they had sent notification of the flight cancellation while I was on the bus from park and ride to the airport just minutes before.) I had arrived for check in two hours before my flight, but Southwest couldn't find any flight with any connections in the entire country except one that got me there five hours later. I asked to be put on standby on an earlier flight and was told that I was #3, but when I showed up to the earlier flight, I was told that I had been bumped down to #7 because I wasn't an ""A lister"". When I objected and said they had lied to me by not telling me the whole truth, I was told that I better calm down or I wouldn't be allowed to fly at all. I was also listed as the very last person to get a seat on the later flight even though I had a much better boarding number on my original flight. Finally, because I complained, they removed me from the TSA pre check for my returning flight. If it was a weather issue, why didn't they just keep our plane on the ground, and let us all take off on hour or so later? When the flight was cancelled in the morning, I had asked to be put on another airline since they couldn't get me on anything earlier on Southwest, and they said that that wasn't required when it was a weather issue.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Ft Lauderdale to Kansas City. We had a very troubling experience with my 6-year-old son flying as an unaccompanied minor on Southwest. He was bumped (although he had a confirmed seat) in favor of standby passengers. Southwest says it was because he didn't have a boarding pass, which apparently can happen even if you check in at the ticketing counter with an actual person who has you sign all the Unaccompanied Minor paperwork and gives both you and your child documentation to go through the security checkpoint. It wasn't a boarding pass! When I called Southwest to get my son onto a different flight, they put him as ""standby"" on a flight going out on Monday morning -- two days later -- and waived the $260 ""change fee."" I called back, asking if he could fly out from a different airport the next day (instead of two days) and they said he could, but I'd have to pay the ""change fee."" They said nobody with the authority to waive the ""change fee"" would be in the customer relations office until Monday morning (the day my son was scheduled to fly as a standby passenger.) Ultimately, I went on Facebook and made a public post. This got results. Southwest changed my son's ticket to a different city so he could depart the next day, with a confirmed seat, and without a ""change fee."" (Kind of proves that there was somebody in the office who had the authority to waive the ""change fee"" at the time they told me I'd have to wait until Monday to talk to someone with that authority.) Then, Southwest didn't answer a bunch of specific questions like, ""What time was my son's confirmed ticket released so that a standby passenger could board?"" and, ""What protocol did the gate agent follow to contact my son's guardians when the gate agent realized that an unaccompanied minor who had checked in at the ticketing desk had not yet picked up his boarding pass?"" In Facebook message, Southwest representatives sent me copies of their ""Unaccompanied Minors"" page of guidelines from their website. They were trying to prove that my son had forfeited his confirmed seat by failing to arrive on time. In fact, the ""Unaccompanied Minors"" page links to another Southwest website page called ""suggested airport arrival times"" which says only that passengers should arrive at the Ft. Lauderdale 60 minutes early for domestic flights. When I pointed out that my son had met these requirements (although NOT the more stringent time requirements being described after the fact by the customer service representative) the Southwest representative wrote, ""I certainly regret if the information your family relied on was not the information provided on the specific Unaccompanied Minor page."" No, ma'am, it was linked on the Unaccompanied Minor page, and there was no other information on the Unaccompanied Minor page. Basically, Southwest representatives bumped my son out of his confirmed seat. Then, they lied to me by saying nobody with the authority to waive the ""change fee"" was available to help me reschedule his flight until Monday. Then, they blamed my family for not following arrival guidelines that were not actually published, and told me that the guidelines we followed (from their public website!) were the wrong ones. Ultimately, the customer service representative told me she had no further information for me, and that she had assigned me a ""file reference number"" to use if I needed to contact their Executive Office.

Here today, I am trying to use my travel credit by Southwest to go to my graduation, and to me disappointed I cannot use my credit for travel for me and dad.

This however was not explained to me when my trip was cancelled or I would have choose the option to receive a refund. I have explained my case to two representatives with Southwest.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Las Vegas to Atlanta. This trip was my first Southwest experience. Flying to Las Vegas was great, staff was friendly, plane was clean, got a great position (A30) to board and select a seat. I paid the additional fee for early check in both ways, and having booked my trip 3 months in advance, I was pleased with my position on the way and expected the same going home. Unfortunately, when it was time to check in for my flight home, I found my position was completely unsatisfactory, B22. I called Southwest to see if there was an error and was told that sometimes it just falls out that way.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Phoenix to Atlanta. This was the first time for me, luckily, to fly on one of the planes with the ""upgraded"" seats. Never again. In fact, I may never fly SWA again unless I absolutely have to. These new ""seats"" have pencil-thin ""arm rests"", without padding, meant to discourgage people from using them - and that design works: if you don't mind elbowing your neighbor, you'll get bruised from the ""arm rest"". The shoulder / arm area is thinner than normal, and unlike the older seat design, even very thin people, such as myself and the passenger on my one side, will be bashing elbows and rubbing legs when constantly shifting positions to try and get away from the constant pain of the seats. See, the seats have no padding. NONE. They seem to be made out of cardboard. There is not just no lumbar support or seat padding: it's shaped oddly the opposite that seating for humans dictates: the lumbar region of the seat goes back rather than forward toward your back, and the seat curves up at the part right under your upper-upper thigh (the seats are also the shortest depth of all seats). While you are hunching your shoulders forward to avoid being shoulder to shoulder with strangers, you have to bring your elbows in front of your chest and hold them there, while your lumbar region is being pushed into an outward curve by the back of the torture seat and your legs have circulation being cut off by the upward curve of the seat edge. After 30 years of flying only SWA for all domestic flights - 8+ in the past 8 months - I will not be flying with them again unless absolutely necessary.

"✅ Trip Verified | I am currently on flight #5823 from Birmingham to San Diego via Las Vegas. The date is January 8 2018. The flight departed at 11.10 am. The only female attendant on the plane is very rude. My 11 month old son was overheating and needed a diaper change. I was at the back of the plane and had to navigate my way to the front of the plane, where for some reason the only changing table is located. The bathroom was occupied. So I was perfectly OK with waiting the few seconds it would take for the bathroom to open up. The woman turned, saw me and without even asking if I needed anything or was OK, snapped, ""you know you can't wait here. You've got to go back to your seat."" I told her we had just gotten up there and that this bathroom was the only one with a changing table. She didn't care so I had to go all the way to the back of the plane and change my son on the pull down tray, which is disgusting for me and the other passengers. As if that wasn't humiliating enough, the woman proceeds to get on the intercom as I'm walking back to my seat to announce (apparently for the millionth time. Her attitude knows no bounds) that no one is allowed to wait at the bathrooms. I have flown Southwest many times, and enjoyed it. Lines have formed many times and it wasn't an issue. But this woman's behavior is unacceptable. My son was overheating and needed a change, yet I basically was not allowed to use the only lavatory on the plane that had a changing table.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Denver to Houston. Absolutely awful experience on Southwest. Flew 12/23 and massive snowstorm hits Denver. Roads getting to airport blocked, hundreds of people unable to reach airport late at night so I called Southwest enroute to state I would not be able to make flight and to rebook for next day. No one picked up on hold for 20 minutes so purchased a separate one way ticket for next morning so I could spend Christmas with family. Sent an email requesting them not to cancel return ticket since I would definitely still use it. On arrival the next morning was told my return ticket was cancelled since I was a “no show” for my original flight.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Reno to Las Vegas return. I fly this route about 3 or so times a year and have always had good service from Southwest. Reno airport is a breeze to go through. The ground staff is friendly with smiles even at 5 a.m., security is quick and then you are at the gate. Had a 6 a.m. departure time which we pushed back from the gate right at, a quick de-icing and off we were. Cabin crew cheerful, the captain gave us updates during the short hour flight. Watched a beautiful sunrise and then we were in Vegas. Only minus was how hard the pilot landed the plane in Vegas. That for sure woke everyone up. Coming home our plane was delayed 20 minutes, then 40 minutes and then finally an hour. We were updated plenty of times with apologies and the reason for the delay. It was all good and we pushed back an hour late but within 5 minutes we were up in the air. Was very windy weather so the takeoff had plenty of ups and downs with bumps and thumps but again the captain kept us informed and said once we get up in altitude all would smooth out. And it did.

I was hopeful that due to my loyalty and this one time oversight, Southwest would at least issue me a credit toward another future flight. That was not the case.

"✅ Verified Review |  St Louis to Atlanta. I have been flying Southwest because they're cheap. The thing they upsell you on is boarding order. For my flight on 9/26 I purchased ""Business Select"" (and paid more for it) for flight 426 so I could get priority boarding. When it came time to board the gate agent allowed everyone to board in whatever order they wanted regardless of their boarding number. I had A-1 but because the gate agent said people could board in whatever order people pushed past me to board first. I asked the gate agent what was going on and why we're not boarding in order. He said to just get on the plane. Once on the plane I asked the lead flight attendant what was going on and she said the flight was light so just take a seat.

✅ Verified Review |  New York to Dallas. Would not fly here again. They notified my hours before my flight by text message saying that they had cancelled my flight and didn't say why so I called and the gentleman said it was because of weather. So I tried rescheduling a flight since my brothers wedding was the next day but they didn't have anything left. So I was told to go to the airport which was 2 hours away and see if I could get on a flight but they just ignored me and said the fastest they could get me out was Monday and the wedding was Saturday. They were super rude and didn't care what happened to me after I stood there 2 hours to talk to someone. I ended up having to spend $500 on a flight out instead of the $150 flight I had booked months ago.

"✅ Verified Review |  Chicago Midway to Phoenix. I set up a vacation for my wife to go see her best friend in Arizona, this is her first time flying. Her flight was scheduled to leave from Midway airport In Chicago at 11:15am. We got there a couple hours early, got through checkout and thought we were good to go! 40 minutes before she's supposed to board, the flight got delayed and was now scheduled to leave at 1:35pm. We left to get some food and was back at the gate by 12:45. They then delay the flight to 2:35. Then  just minutes later they cancel the flight! Went to the counter to ask what to do. They told us as long as the ticket had today's date we can go to terminal B17 and catch that flight. So we go to B17 and they informed us that was wrong and that they were ""probably just trying to get us through the line"". We then had to go stand in a different line, which we waited in that line for an hour and a half and in that time only went half way. I finally go up to the terminal attendant to ask him what we can do. He again said we need to wait in that line in hopes of being put on standby. Luckily a pilot overheard him and asked me what was going on. So I explained the story and he kindly went behind the desk and told them to change her over to that flight! I thought we were home free, but I was mistaken. He told her that instead of being a direct flight like the original flight I booked her, there would be a layover in Oakland. He said she wouldn't have to leave the plane when they go there. She called me in Oakland saying they forced her off the plane and since the pilot had the ticket she didn't have a ticket to show the attendant who was rude. So she got off the plane and tried explaining to the attendant what happened. The attendant told her ""to bad cause you don't have a ticket"". My wife went up to the counter panicking. The woman made a few calls and almost an hour later was able to get her on the flight to Phoenix. In Phoenix she was supposed to be picking up a rental car from Advantage (I purchased everything through southwest.com) and when I called to verify the car they said there wasn't a reservation. When I called to ask Southwest, they said they don't rent through Advantage. I asked to speak to a supervisor and they confirmed they do in fact rent through Advantage. Something apparently happened in processing the rental car so now her friend has to drive to Phoenix to pick her up.

"✅ Verified Review |  Atlanta to Dallas Love Field. Our frustrating and unexpectantly expensive situation with Southwest Airlines began on Sunday August 6th 2017 after having spent a wonderful weekend in Georgia at Ft. Benning to celebrate our son’s graduation from Boot Camp. Our group consisted of our son’s 3 parents and 1 elderly grandmother who needs physical assistance getting around. Ready to head to the Atlanta airport to catch our flight (2419) back to Dallas Love Field, we received an elctronic message stating that our flight was cancelled due to thunderstorms over Dallas. We called home (Dallas) to check with our house sitter and other friends to hear what the weather was like. They said there were no storms at all. It was clear skies and very hot. I checked my weather app and saw no storms in the DFW area. We called Southwest customer service who said we could spend the night in a hotel in Atlanta and catch a flight to Dallas the next morning. But we needed to get back to work the next morning (a Monday). We asked for reimbursement for the 4 tickets we will need to by from other airlines. SWA Rep said we would need to call Customer Relations. But a refund is not possible since the cancellation was due to weather! When we arrived at the Atlanta airport we ran to the American Airlines ticket window and bought the last 2 AA tickets flying to DFW that evening for $536.40! AA ticket counter rep told us all flights to Dallas and DFW airports were flying with no weather issues. So we let our son’s mother and elderly grandmother have these 2 tickets since we were not sure there would be any other available flights out that night. Then we ran to the other end of the terminal to the Delta ticket counter. We bought 2 tickets to DFW for $654.32! Delta also confirmed no weather issues flying into the DFW area. The total for 4 tickets including terminal fees cost us $1,217.72! I called SWA Customer Relations the next day to inquire about a refund for the 4 tickets we had to purchase due to the SWA cancellation. We spoke to SWA Customer Relations rep at the corporate office in Dallas TX. He said no refund is given when a cancellation is made due to weather. He said the FAA said there were thunderstorms over Dallas. I shared that I called friends in various locations in Dallas and NO ONE saw a single could in the sky. I shared that ALL other airlines were flying from Atlanta to Dallas that afternoon and evening with no knowledge of storms in Dallas. SWA refused to offer even partial compensation. He said talking to anyone above him would be wasting my time and would not transfer me to a supervisor. I hung up. It was obvious SWA was not going to acknowledge they made a mistake cancelling our flight or even apologize for causing such unnecessary stress and expense costing us over $1,200.00 in additional ticket fees.

"✅ Verified Review |  We had an awful experience traveling from Ft. Lauderdale to Albuquerque on Southwest Airlines yesterday. First let me say that SWA has always been our airline of choice, but yesterday we experienced terrible customer service, and I do not know if we will ever fly with them again. At the Ft. Lauderdale airport our flight was delayed by an hour and a half. We asked to re-rout the remainder of our flights, but we were assured that we had plenty of time to make all of our flights, so we had no need to re-rout. Our flight touched down in Nashville to allow more passengers to board the plane, the flight was then held on the ground to allow passengers that had been re-routed time to board the plane so that they could make connecting flights. We asked for help from the flight attendants, but were told it was out of their hands. When the flight landed in Denver we had fifteen minutes to catch our connecting flight, but the pilot announced that we could not get a gate, so we were held on the tarmac until after our flight left. At this point we went to the gate to ask for help and were told that we were held in Nashville so that many more people could make connecting flights, it was a business decision to hold us up so that more people could make their flights. We were told that we had been rebooked on the first flight out the next morning at 6:50 am (it was 10:00 at this time). I asked to speak to a supervisor because we now had to spend an unplanned night in Denver ""so that more people could make connecting flights, a business decision."" The same supervisor refused to give us a hotel voucher stating that he had already given away all vouchers for the day, but offered us a worthless coupon for a ""discount"" on a Best Western hotel room ($157-unsure when he could have a shuttle pick us up) or a no name hotel for $69 no shuttle.

✅ Verified Review |  Northwest Florida Beaches to Nashville. I'm delayed at PCB airport with a baby and have made multiple attempts to get released from this flight and rebooked so I can get my daughter to a hotel and in the bed. We left the upstairs area where we were boarding without knowing we couldn't get back through and although I've spoken to several people here who work for SWA everyone here is telling me they can't help me and I'll have to keep waiting. I've also called the customer service number to attempt to make the changes that way and they to aren't assisting me. All I need to do is rebook a flight for tomorrow and no one has shown any interest in helping me despite the fact that I have a very exhausted and upset child who needs to be in the bed. This has been by far the worst customer service experience I've ever had with an airline and will definitely cause me to reconsider ever booking another SWA flight.

"✅ Verified Review |  First time flying this airline (RDU-MCO-RDU), and I have to say I'm impressed with the service overall. It's no frills, but the customer service is excellent and two free checked bags is even better.

Both were full flights and on time, while the return flight was eight minutes early. Considering late afternoon flights from Orlando tend to get delayed due to late afternoon storms, that was a nice change.

Southwest had us on the plane so we were captive to their whim. Now after an exhausting week, again we are delayed an hour (could be more) leaving St. Louis to return to Atlanta.

"✅ Verified Review |  Sacramento to San Antonio via San Diego. My flights with Southwest Airlines were fine. On the return flight - the copilot actually came down the aisle and introduced himself and wished everyone a good flight - nice touch. My issue came with the connecting gates in San Diego - Gates 1, 1A and 2. The first flight from Sacramento to San Diego - I had to change gates. Much to my surprise, I had to go through TSA security again because you walked from a secure area to a non-secure area. Even though I purchased a bottle of water in a secure area at the originating gate - I had to toss it because of the 2nd TSA security screen. On the way back - I had purchased a few items from the gift shops while waiting for my flight. Unfortunately, I had to change gates in San Diego - and had to go through the 2nd TSA security screen again. During this screen, I was told I could not keep a bottle of jelly I had purchased in the gift shop (receipt still in the bag) because it was over the limit - how incredibly ridiculous is that? I wasn't leaving the area without my purchased jelly - I didn't break any rules and I was going to be penalized due to SWA sending passengers on connecting flights through those gates. At one point I was told to just go back and get my luggage and place the jelly in my luggage - seriously? I just got off a plane and am in the process of going to a gate for my connecting flight - how on earth am I supposed to go get my bag? After speaking to the TSA supervisor and making it very clear I was not leaving without my jelly - the TSA agent decided they would test the jelly for whatever they test liquids for and then wrapped it up and handed it back to me after it passed the test. I can't be the first passenger this has happened to and the TSA agents explained they had made SWA aware of this issue but nothing had been done. For goodness sake SWA, use a little common sense and fix this issue. Have passengers who have to use those gates for connecting flights enter a separate area divided by security glass or stop routing passengers to those gates if they are changing gates for connecting flights. The current situation is beyond frustrating and really is inexcusable - there has to be a simple fix and if it isn't a simple fix - you should still fix it because it is a huge issue for your customers. For now - traveler beware - if you are changing gates during travel - avoid the San Diego airport because if your connecting flight is through gates 1, 1A or 2 - you can kiss that water or any gifts you just purchased in the secure area of your last flight that are liquid good-bye.",Business,Economy Class,Baltimore to Orlando,June 2017,no,    sacramento to san antonio via san diego my flights with southwest airlines were fine on the return flight  the copilot actually came down the aisle and introduced himself and wished everyone a good flight  nice touch my issue came with the connecting gates in san diego  gates 1 1a and 2 the first flight from sacramento to san diego  i had to change gates much to my surprise i had to go through tsa security again because you walked from a secure area to a nonsecure area even though i purchased a bottle of water in a secure area at the originating gate  i had to toss it because of the 2nd tsa security screen on the way back  i had purchased a few items from the gift shops while waiting for my flight unfortunately i had to change gates in san diego  and had to go through the 2nd tsa security screen again during this screen i was told i could not keep a bottle of jelly i had purchased in the gift shop receipt still in the bag because it was over the limit  how incredibly ridiculous is that i wasnt leaving the area without my purchased jelly  i didnt break any rules and i was going to be penalized due to swa sending passengers on connecting flights through those gates at one point i was told to just go back and get my luggage and place the jelly in my luggage  seriously i just got off a plane and am in the process of going to a gate for my connecting flight  how on earth am i supposed to go get my bag after speaking to the tsa supervisor and making it very clear i was not leaving without my jelly  the tsa agent decided they would test the jelly for whatever they test liquids for and then wrapped it up and handed it back to me after it passed the test i cant be the first passenger this has happened to and the tsa agents explained they had made swa aware of this issue but nothing had been done for goodness sake swa use a little common sense and fix this issue have passengers who have to use those gates for connecting flights enter a separate area divided by security glass or stop routing passengers to those gates if they are changing gates for connecting flights the current situation is beyond frustrating and really is inexcusable  there has to be a simple fix and if it isnt a simple fix  you should still fix it because it is a huge issue for your customers for now  traveler beware  if you are changing gates during travel  avoid the san diego airport because if your connecting flight is through gates 1 1a or 2  you can kiss that water or any gifts you just purchased in the secure area of your last flight that are liquid goodbye,sacramento san antonio via san diego flights southwest airlines fine return flight copilot actually came aisle introduced wished everyone good flight nice touch issue came connecting gates san diego gates 1 1a 2 first flight sacramento san diego change gates much surprise go tsa security walked secure area nonsecure area even though purchased bottle water secure area originating gate toss 2nd tsa security screen way back purchased items gift shops waiting flight unfortunately change gates san diego go 2nd tsa security screen screen told could keep bottle jelly purchased gift shop receipt still bag limit incredibly ridiculous wasnt leaving area without purchased jelly didnt break rules going penalized due swa sending passengers connecting flights gates one point told go back get luggage place jelly luggage seriously got plane process going gate connecting flight earth supposed go get bag speaking tsa supervisor making clear leaving without jelly tsa agent decided would test jelly whatever test liquids wrapped handed back passed test cant first passenger happened tsa agents explained made swa aware issue nothing done goodness sake swa use little common sense fix issue passengers use gates connecting flights enter separate area divided security glass stop routing passengers gates changing gates connecting flights current situation beyond frustrating really inexcusable simple fix isnt simple fix still fix huge issue customers traveler beware changing gates travel avoid san diego airport connecting flight gates 1 1a 2 kiss water gifts purchased secure area last flight liquid goodbye,NEU

"✅ Verified Review | Since 1999, I have flown Southwest and never had problems with it. They have decent seats, and the staff has been friendly and helpful. In addition, Southwest prices are generally fair that customer can purchase tickets in advance for cheaper than most other carriers. They have added some decent flights which were beneficial to our whereabouts. Their boarding process, although different, works well. Fort Lauderdale Airport's Concourse B requires more expansion of rooms and gates because I see the heavy crowd, which makes me uncomfortable to walk. Sometimes chairs are full; you have to stand up, waiting to board. There are few plugs to charge devices. Tampa Airport's Concourse C looks very neat and comfortable. There are many plugs to charge devices. Thus, I have heard Southwest has 101 destinations in the United States and 8 additional countries that its airline connections are expanding. I have been flying often B737, which is great planes with good seats, and I hope Southwest buy more new next generation Boeing planes with more room for legs. Lastly, Southwest Airlines offers internet service using a satellite-based Wi-Fi provider. Cost per device for Wi-Fi access is $8. I know Wi-Fi is not free, and I wish Southwest offer us for 100% free Wi-Fi in order to contact with families and/or friends and watch streaming movies or shows.

"✅ Verified Review |  It was the worst flight I've ever taken. Flew from Fort Lauderdale, FL to Islip, NY. They delayed us an hour due to weather, 2 hours due to air traffic control, and then 5 hours because the pilot's hours to fly had expired and they needed to find another crew. Found a crew and then the crew cancelled at 2am. They then made me wait in a line for 3 hours to change my flight. I was in the airport for 12 hours straight and all they provided me was a mini bag of mini pretzels and 6oz water. They refused a hotel, transportation and food after keeping us in an airport for 12 hours just to cancel the flight. They expected me to travel for 24 hours straight starting at 6am. Meaning they wanted me to stay up for 48 hours straight. I get on the flight for 24 hours later, a direct flight and they delayed my 6.20pm flight until 10.45pm. I had to reschedule my flight for the following day yet again and they weren't willing to provide hotel, transportation or food once again. So my flight was initially 6.30pm from Fort Lauderdale and we were supposed to land at 9.20pm in Islip. We were given an hour delay due to weather (7.30pm-10.30pm). After the delay, we boarded the plane (7.00pm). They then proceeded to keep us on the plane for over an hour as directed by federal air traffic control (8.00pm). Then they made us sit another hour on the plane demanding that we all stay in our seats and stay buckled because they expected to depart soon (9pm). After this hour, the pilot comes on the PA system and told us that he's reached the maximum number of consecutive hours that the pilot policies allow (9.30). They took us back to the gate where we were given no updates or information for at least 2 hours (11.30). After this, they told us that they were trying to find a pilot and crew to fly the plane. They then told us that our flight would board at 12.50am. They delayed us twice more until they cancelled my flight at approximately 2am. They automatically rebooked me for a flight that would board at 8.30am in Fort Lauderdale and would bring me to Tampa. They would then give me a 10 hour layover in Tampa. I would board the 10.30pm flight to Islip and get back at approximately 1.30am. I waited in a line 3 hours to get this changed and also demanded a hotel, transportation, and food (5am). They hadn't fed us anything but a mini sized bag of mini pretzels and 6oz of water in 13 hours. They refused a hotel. They refused transportation. They refused food. They also told me that they could not change this horrible flight. I went back to them twice and harassed them before they finally put me on a flight that boarded exactly 24 hours from the one I originally had.

"✅ Verified Review |  I have flown Southwest in the past and never had problems with it. However, this last trip was very upsetting due to the very rude customer service. We had a flight from Chicago to Dallas and then to El Paso which is home for us. From Chicago to Dallas as we started approaching Dallas the weather conditions became difficult and we knew we were going to have delays. It took an hour to land and I completely understand and would never complain about the fact that there are delays due to weather and also due to keeping us safe. Once we landed our next flight was delayed for about an hour. So we hung around and waited. Then it got delayed for another half hour, 45 minutes, then delayed for 15 more minutes, etc. The delays kept coming, then finally they said we were going to board. So they told us they would be ready to board but they couldn't find a pilot. This was at around 11:30 pm. So they kept saying a pilot was on his way and any minute now we will board. Around 1 am I get a notification that the flight has been cancelled. I wish it could have gotten cancelled earlier so we could make accommodations as to where to sleep. I don't understand how you don't have a pilot. And if that's the case, then please just tell us with time so we can make accommodations. People started running to Southwest counters and we were notified that only 2 counters were open. They said you can call and rebook or wait in line at the counter. I called as I waited in line and they told me they could not assist me over the phone because I had a bag checked in. When the counters opened everybody ran to the counter and I had to pick up my 5 year old who was asleep on the floor so by the time I got to the counter I was toward the end of the line. I stood in line until about 3:45 am. When it was finally my turn, the staff was extremely rude. They treated us like we should be grateful they were even lifting a finger for us. The first lady I talked to was Chinese and had broken English. As soon as I walked up she rolled her eyes at me. Before I even spoke. I felt contempt seeing as I was the one who had been standing in line close to 4 hours. But I am a nice person so I decided to smile and be polite anyway. I asked her to please rebook my flight as early as possible and she gave me 2 options: one for 7 am departure connecting at Austin which was already delayed or one for 7 pm direct flight. I told her I was skeptical about the 7 am one since it was already delayed but 7 pm is such a long time to wait when you don't have anywhere to sleep or shower and my luggage is checked in. She gave me a look of not my problem tapped her fingers on the counter and told me to pick one. I asked her if they could help accommodate us so we could sleep somewhere and at this she became very angry and told me ""we aren't going to give you anything!"" She treated me like I was trying to get some ""advantage"" of the situation. I just wanted a place to sleep, and if there's nothing to be done there is a way to state things politely. I told her I needed to think it over and I would come back but really I wanted to not be taken care of by her. I went back in line and got another representative. He was a little bit nicer but he also kept chatting to the guy next to him for long periods of time as if I wasn't there. Maybe the system was reloading or maybe he was just ignoring me. I saw a lot of people crying and I don't blame them.

"✅ Verified Review |  Washington to Providence. This was the first time I had flown Southwest in several years, never having had a problem in the past. This time was different! The departure flight was delayed 1.5 hours because of a ""plane switch"" related to a mechanical problem. While this was mildly annoying, I did not complain to any staff personnel. The delay on my return flight 2 days later was twice as long--3 hours--and for the same reason. By then, my patience was exhausted, so I asked for more information from the gate attendant. She informed me that our particular scheduled aircraft had not experienced any problem but instead had been rerouted to the west coast from Chicago to replace a plane that had been delayed for several hours while undergoing repairs, in other words, another ""plane switch."" That plane was instead used to ferry us to Wash., DC. Had repairs taken longer, we would have been stuck even longer in Providence, unless Southwest had decided to spread the misery even more. Southwest offered no alternative flights on other airlines nor did they offer a voucher as compensation for the delay. If their planes are so unreliable, perhaps they need to establish sharing arrangements with other airlines or keep planes in reserve for such occasions.

We were one of the last to board and it was obvious we were together (tickets purchased together). Not one staff member tried to help and see if they could get us seats together. The icing on the cake was the horrible uncomfortable flight between two larger men. At this point I had fully decided, we would not fly Southwest again. Fortunately this flight was only 2.5hrs.

Angrily, I re-boarded the plane and was the last person to get on, and had to sit in the only seat available in the very back of the plane. When I got to my connecting flight, I was supposed to stay on the airplane and go to the next city. Upon landing, I was told to get off the airplane and would be moved to another plane at a different gate. This gate and plane change was not the only inconvenience, the plane would now be delayed by 2.5 hours! This would put me in at 01:40am! My husband has to work in the morning and we live nearly an hour away from the airport, so he has to come get me in the middle of the night. My original arrival time would have been at 22.50 or (10.50 pm). The ticket lady told me that the pilot forgot his passport in Cancun? I'm not sure what that has to do with why the plane was over two hours late. This infuriated me. I am a frequent customer with this airline because of their cheap fares.

The straw that broke the camel's back was me booking travel for my wife to meet me in DC for Spring break. I booked the ticket in January for travel March 28th. When I left four days earlier for DC neither my wife or I received her confirmation, so Saturday I call Southwest. The ticketing agent was great about helping us find my wife's confirmation, she informed me I accidently made it for the 21st not the 28th, and that they recorded it as a no-show. She said usually you forfeit the funds, but in this case purchase a replacement short notice replacement for the date you wanted, the 28th, then M-F call our customer relations team and they will allow you to use the prior dollars spent as a credit for 12 months against future travel. Well today the 28th from my tradeshow I waited over 20 minutes until the agent answered the phone, at 9:15am. She was very terse with me and said it didn't matter what the ticketing agent told me Saturday, that I did have to forfeit the few hundred dollars I spent on the prior ticket I did not use.

Traveling one way to New Orleans for a sports competition my wife was participating in. Needed to check a couple of bags, using a Kiosk.

We fly often enough with Southwest, so we are familiar with the boarding process, which to tell the truth, if I have to fly coach, I prefer. We always pay the earlybird check in fee, we are always in group A, even though it's not guaranteed, so we always get a good choice of seats. Sitting together, had a window and aisle, row 2, as the flight was not full this morning. Fast boarding, on time departure, quick taxi and we were off.

This is the first and last time I fly Southwest. I'm very dissapointed after hearing nothing but great things about the airline. I flew in from Dallas Lovefield to Phoenix Arizona for a business meeting. On my way out of Dallas I found no line. But I did find two female Southwest employees at the check in counter chatting about the night before. They were very disinterested in being engaged with me during the chek in process but they got the job done and checked my bag in, as well as print my boarding pass for me. When it came time to board I was in the B group. That was far enough back to land me in the last row by the bathroom but at least it was an aisle seat. Great since I'm 28-going on 29 weeks pregnant and I may need to get up to use the rest room. I've only flown American and Delta with assigned seats. I hate this open seating policy because the person who came to sit next to me was a large man who barely fit into the middle seat and caused for an uncomfortable ride. I had to lean out toward the aisle the entire flight. Once we landed they open the back door to reload snacks and drinks for the plane that is going on to San Diego I believe. No big deal until the plan begins to get refueled! The fumes were so strong and awful. Fast forward a day, I'm pleased to go home to Dallas, hoping for better luck with my seat this time. Unfortunately my pass says I'm in group C. Even further out from boarding than on my flight in.

"Very happy with Southwest Airlines. Traveled from Minneapolis to Phoenix with my wife and 5 kids (ages 1,3,5,7 and 9). It has been many years since I have flown and never for any of the kids. First got to the check in counter and baggage drop off in Minneapolis - not knowing procedure we were greeted right away with a smile and very friendly employee. We were checked in right away and given instructions on where to go and what we would need to do when we got to the gate with our stroller. Proceeded to go through security, again nervous as to how smoothly this would go with all the horrible stories I have heard. TSA agent checking our id's was very friendly and good about telling us where to go and what was expected of us to get though security. Got to the Southwest gate and before I could even get over to the agent he came over asked about the stroller and went back to the counter and came back a minute later with a claim ticket and label for our stroller. They explained we would board after the A ticket holders and wheel chairs as a family. We boarded the plane got to pick our seats 3 on the left side and 4 on the right with the 1 year old on my wifes lap. All Southwest attendants were nice and friendly during the flight.

"✅ Verified Review |  Phoenix to Spokane WA. No problems. Even though I was the last of about 150 people boarding (having misunderstood the online preboarding process, I wound up having to get my boarding pass at the airport) and had to take a middle seat between two guys, who both seemed to be recovering from chest colds, my 2.2-hour run from Phoenix to Spokane was fine. Nice staff at both ends of the process. Seat not too tight. Neighboring passengers courteous. A fair boarding process. No delays. The price: not a terrific deal (my round-trip ticket between Spokane and Phoenix was just below $500), but not ruinously expensive, and this was, after all, Thanksgiving. I feel positive about this trip partly because of my last flight, from Honolulu to Ithaca, NY. That was via United. United treated coach-class passengers like sacks of dirt. It canceled a flight (D.C. to Syracuse) with no better excuse than that it was under-booked, offered no apologies, made people stand in line for one hour to get alternative routing, ultimately made me spend an extra night in Syracuse, at a cost of about $100.

"The first, only and last time we will be traveling with Southwest. They say ""open seating"" makes the boarding faster. It doesn't. It makes it easier on their end because they do not have to spend the labor on seat selections, etc. It is more like being treated like cattle in a chute. When you get to the plane, you are still waiting to get seated, just like every other airline out there. If you are lucky, you might get to sit with your other family members. Our family was not the only one that had to sit scattered throughout the plane. The attempts at humor by the flight staff did not help much either. The seats were cramped to point my shoulders hust from being so scrunched up and I am not that big of a person, 5'10"", 220lbs. The beverage service gets you about 4 sips of your drink unless you order coffee or adult beverage. One of our pieces of luggage was severely damaged so we got a $50 coupon to be used on Southwest airlines and only on Southwest airlines. I think we are throwing it away.

I told him not to worry and he could go ahead since he had more important things to do, but he waited and seemed happy to help.

"I have been flying Southwest for over ten years and have the southwest credit card as well. I put several thousands of dollars on it a year but have noticed that I get a lot less flights with it now. I liked how they started giving you a boarding number when you check in 24 hours in advance so there aren't people arguing about the lines. But now what people are doing is saving seats all the time and it has gotten carried away. I have talked to the flight attendants about it but they say they will not get involved with it. I check in 24 hours in advance on the dot to get the best seats possible but am going farther and farther back from people saving seats now. What the customers are doing is one will get the early bird pass to get an advanced seating number and then save the remaining seats for the passengers that are flying with them. I actually was going to sit down on one flight and a woman said she was saving seven seats which was three rows and I finally said no, you cannot do that since my boarding pass was before them. She started getting loud and the flight attendant was no help whatsoever. I am not going back any further on the plane simply because others are not working with the rules Southwest has determined and does nothing for the people who play by the rules.

"✅ Verified Review |  Ft Lauderdale to Las Vegas.  I like Southwest Airlines. The rates are reasonable. There are no hidden fees, or change fees, or bag fees.

People who work for Southwest in my experience seem happy to do so. The planes are all Boeing 737's and for economy class seating, there is better space than many other airlines. The inflight entertainment is via wifi on your own device, which means no footwell intrusions from IFE boxes or bulky seatbacks.

Flew Austin to Phoenix. Southwest Airlines used to be my favorite airline to fly particularly because of how easy it was to cancel and change flights, their rewards program, and especially how helpful their attendants were. Over time, some of their best value points have changed. Their reward system has made it more difficult to receive reward flights. There was a time that you could show up to the airport early, and if their was a seat available on an earlier flight, they would accommodate you, but they no longer do this without charging you the fare difference which is really expensive on a day of flight. I must say worst of all is their service and customer service. Each Southwest Airlines personnel that you deal with from the time you check in, until exiting the plane is rude or in a bad mood, unwilling to help or accommodate your needs. I have a service animal, and three times, at three different points within one round trip experience I was harassed after being cleared twice. I was humiliated and embarrassed.

Flew from Dallas to Kansas City. It was my first time checking a car seat and stroller at the gate so I wasn't quite sure of the process. The woman 'helping' was rude, and even made a snide comment in regards to me not understanding where to sign the liability tags. We, my 2 young daughter's (1 & 11) and myself, loaded the plane last. I was concerned about having 2 seats together, and the stewardess was less than accommodating. She did say she would find 2 middle seats close together but that was the best she could do. Fortunately, an older gentleman gave his seat up for us to sit next to each other. I graciously thanked the man, and then thanked the stewardess whom then told me not to thank her and that I needed to thank him. Thankfully the gentleman who was collecting boarding passes was the only pleasant encounter I had. He insisted on taking the stroller and car seat for us because our hands were full, and made sure to go ahead of us and tell the flight crew that we would need 2 seats together so they could begin working on it.

"Phoenix to Seattle. My flight from Seattle to Phoenix I would rate that trip an 8/9 score (flight attendants were very friendly and helpful from the time I checked in until my exit from the plane. Their concern was that I was comfortable and in the least amount of pain throughout the flying experience with them). Return flight was a whole different type of experience. My flight returning from Phoenix to Seattle (flight 2193) was horrific. I have disabilities that require a cane and a wheel chair at times. During the pre board the wheel chair assisted individuals were squeezed in between other passengers loading (very chaotic) we were barely noticed that we needed to board before the crowds pushed in. The employee that seemed to be in charge at the time, taking the tickets grabbed my wheel chair and quickly/aggressively pushed my wheel chair so fast/hard over the turns and bumps in the ramp that I told him twice to stop and slow down. He was rude to customers loading the plane. He left me and walked away at the entrance of the plane (did not secure the wheel chair, lift the foot pads or help get the luggage off of my lap or give me my cane). I was then met by another rude Southwest flight attendant that just watched me struggle to get out of the wheelchair and try to set my luggage down. She did not once offer to help in anyway. I told her I need to get the luggage in the overhead bin and she just stared at me with an attitude on her face/body language. I finally said that my luggage would just sit there because I couldn't put it in the overhead bin. She finally grabbed the bag and put it up.  I asked for my cane that was put in the overhead area so I could use the rest room and again with the attitude when assistance was needed.

"Reno to Las Vegas return. I fly this route several times a year and Southwest delivers a fine product. This time we were traveling with our 90 year old father who requires assistance and wheelchair which we requested. The wheelchair was waiting for us at the airport when we arrived and we were assisted by very nice ground staff all the way to entering the plane. We had to gate check his walker which was promptly waiting for us when we arrived in Las Vegas along with a wheelchair and more assistance from the ground crew. It was all very well done. On our return flight we ran into all kinds of horrible traffic delays due to the Presidential Debate taking place just a few blocks away from the airport. The highways and roads were all closed leading to the airport so when we realized that we would not make our flight we called Customer Service, explained our situation and rebooked for a later flight. The agent was understanding, very pleasant and had us rebooked at no charge within 5 minutes. Upon arrival at the airport a wheelchair was waiting and again the ground crew offered great assistance all the way to the plane.

Heavy headwind extended the flight to 4.5 hours. Southwest doesn't control the wind however, they did make the slightly longer flight highly entertaining. About half way to Seattle, the flight attendants decided we needed to play Blackout Bingo. Seriously funny with the quips from the flight crew including the pilot and co-pilot. The flight crew did everything possible to make the flight entertaining. Kudos to the Southwest crew for going above and beyond to make the passengers enjoy a somewhat long flight enjoyable.

"✅ Verified Review | Traveled by myself from Grand Rapids to Philadelphia with a stop in Chicago Midway. Looked at prices for other airlines and I saw nothing less than $350 round trip. A co-worker suggested I check Southwest Airlines website since they don't pop up on Priceline and other travel websites and found the same flight for $240. Good first impression there. When I arrived I learned that my first flight from GRR to MDW was delayed 45 minutes as the plane was stuck in IAD - however, the attendants seemed very eager to get us to our destination and boarded those with close connecting flights first so they wouldn't miss them. I was impressed even further by the friendliness of the ground service. Great sense of humor. This was a reoccurring theme on each flight. Planes were clean and well maintained. I understand some of the planes received new seats which supposedly are far superior to the old ones. Wasn't super comfortable but better than any I've sat in on an American Airlines flight. I purchased wifi for 8 bucks and it lasted for the entire day, so I used it on both flights even though I had to change planes. Cabin service was efficient with a large selection of drinks. Attendants were very personable and helpful. I like how they read gate info before landing. Also worth noting that I travelled alone. I can see how their open seating process could negatively effect groups of people traveling together. They do offer family boarding after the A group boards which was neat to see. I landed a first row seat 3 of my 4 flights and it was very spacious but all carry on must be stored above. If you're traveling light it's worth climbing over a few people as the leg room was fantastic. Overall great first impression of Southwest. No large complaints worth noting. Can't beat their prices.

Nashville to Tampa with Southwest Airlines. My flight was cancelled with minimum notice. They had the entire full flight go to the 2 agents at the gate to rebook (they did not even tell people there was an option to go up front to check-in). Being A-List Preferred I called the number and they tried to put me in an open seat on the 1:55pm flight but they could not help because somehow SWA closed making reservation changes to them from flight 37. After the A List plus folks could not help I went to front check in but they had no ability to get me out until the 9:45pm flight. Despite my Business Select fare I got a boarding pass with position B5 on it. When I complained I paid the high fare and was A-List Preferred they said they could do nothing but I could try to better myself (13 hours later) at the gate. They also said if I called back Monday they would connect me with customer service. In addition to going out 13 hours later I had to wait 1 hour to get my bag back and leaving the airport paid $12 for parking that would have been included in my regular parking fee for 24 hours.

"Albuquerque, NM to San Antonio, TX via Dallas, Love Field TX. I have been making about 8 to 10 flights a year for at least 9 years. My family lives in RI, and I live in NM. So I travel cross country once or twice a year, plus vacation and work trips to the Bahamas, Florida, Quebec, Mexico, and last winter Cambodia. I have always attempted to fly Southwest Airlines in the past, whenever traveling (domestic) to a location that they have service to, and I generally try to avoid American Airlines. Over the last few years flying is less and less of a faster trip, due to lengthy waits in security, and the expectation that we travelors arrive at the airport earlier and earlier, as well as layovers that get longer and more frequent delays. In the last couple of years I have come to expect that, unless I am flying on the very first flight of the day, I will be delayed. I have mentally added that time to overall travel time, when planning a trip. Southwest always seems to deliver that midday delay, and I now expect it. Today, Southwest outdid themselves. I think I may finally reached the point where voluntarily flying is perhaps no longer worth it. Maybe I would rather stay home. There have been several moments today when I wished that I could leave the airport and just go home. Why am I so set on spending the time and money to somewhere else anyway? I can go swimming in Albuquerque. The first such moment was when I got to the airport at 7:00 am for my 8:55 flight only to discover that it does not exist anymore. It was posted as delayed, now it's just gone. I have to wait until I am called to be told how I will be rerouted.  So now I am leaving an hour and 50 minutes later, to make a Dallas flight that will take off about 2 hours later. So I can still pick up my rental car during daylight. I make it to Dallas, I get on the plane, we are a bit delayed because we need to get some more gas because we need to fly around some heavy traffic to get to San Antonio.  No we are now waiting an additional hour and 45, due to bad weather. Well, ok, I can still do my drive before it gets dark (I've never driven in San Antonio). I can even get off the plane if I want, I will just have to reboard (because that is so much fun). So it is really pretty hot in here, but it is too late to go home. We can leave now, (so they say). We just have to wait for the passengers to get back on the plane. Did Southwest get new management?

"Writing this review not as a passenger but as the uncle of my nephew who attempted to fly from Chicago Midway to Albuquerque on WN 563 on July 21st. Yes - Southwest had a computer meltdown and their flights were all messed up. This has happened before to them and other airlines. But alas it always comes down to how an airline handles things like this that differentiates them from others. My nephew is Italian and doesn't speak English fluently and is 14, so I needed to get the Escort pass from the ticket counter. The line was over 1,000 people long if not more, stretching into back halls. I told the SW agents at the line entrances I just needed to get the Escort pass as he can't go thru alone. No - no help. Rude people who just say - get in line. There was no one at the Business Fare line - literally no one - and she wouldn't just let me go up there to get the pass. I had used a Skycap to check his bag in as that line was only 50 people long, so literally just needed the agent to give me the pass. Not a single SW person helped me - but going back to the Skycap - he did! He stopped what he was doing and walked me back to the counter and had an agent quickly issue me the pass. So simple - didn't really stop the process of handling other passengers. Just for this I wouldn't fly SW again - there was no reason the Biz counter couldn't have helped me (and 2 other passengers needing just a quick minute with an agent. So we go thru security - eat and go to the gate where it says ""on time"". Some flights delayed, some cancelled, some on time. They board other flights, at our boarding time they have people line up, flight attendants already on board. Then an announcement: ""Flight 536 is cancelled, we have no pilots, please get in line for rebooking"". No apology - in fact the 4 hours at Midway not a single SWA agent said I'm sorry for what was happening - just deal with it. So I get on the SWA app and the only flight I can get for my nephew is on the 23rd of June. Ok - so now ask an agent how I can get his bag. No - no way, we are not pulling bags from flights. I said he is 14 and has no clothes here as he is visiting. Sorry - we are not pulling bags. I said some choice words to her and then she says to speak to a supervisor. Wait 45 min in line - the supervisor says no - with a smile - and I can try to go to baggage claim and see if someone there would help. So I go to baggage claim - and the agent there is friendly - but she is just guiding people as that line is 20 people long. She said the bag will go to ABQ and just let it go. If I wait in the line they may not pull it, or if they do it could be hours. At least she was friendly. So for 2 days my nephew will not have any of his things - not a dire situation - he can wear my clothes. But again - it was just the sheer nature of the SWA agents. No compassion, not friendly, not helpful. I will never spend a single penny at Southwest again. SWA has gotten too big for its britches - they used to be good in the 80s and 90s, now just one of the Big 4 and treating passengers like cattle.

We have always had a great experience when flying with Southwest and with their customer service. For this reason, we have always been willing to pay the extra dollars to book our flights through them, as opposed to booking with one of the cheaper airlines. However, the last 3 times we have flown Southwest have been just awful. They lost our car seat the first time, our luggage the second time, and then the third time we experienced a 3.5 hour delay followed by a cancelled flight at 9.30pm. On top of this, we have encountered terrible customer service every step of the way in dealing with these stressful circumstances. Each time we traveled the personnel working at the ticket counter have been unbelievably rude. Great way to start the trip. When items were lost, instead of being helpful and accommodating, the customer service agent working in lost baggage was very brusque and actually yelled at us, and then refused to do something as simple as validate a $7 parking ticket for my husband who had to park and come in to help me with the situation since I was traveling alone with our 6 month old. Finally, when we were flying home to Denver, our flight was delayed 3.5 hours and then cancelled. The entire time the woman working the gates to the flight was yelling at people and being extremely rude. We all had to wait 1-2 hours in line to rebook our flights, and then we found out the next day when we called in that they never even rebooked a flight for us. We will be leaving 2 days after our expected and paid for departure date. On top of all of this, we have not been compensated for any of these inconveniences.

"Denver to Cancun with Southwest Airlines. We were a group travelling for a wedding on 1 flight. No one was able to sit together.

It would make more sense to limit the carry on because that is what slows down the boarding process, not assigned seating.

RNO-LAS roundtrip. Both flights were spot on time. First flight on rather colorful Southwest livery plane (Maryland). The flight was a bit bumpy so the pilot asked that beverage service be halted but the last 15 minutes of the flight was fine so the crew served the whole plane and collected trash in a short matter of time. Also the little girl sitting next to me was celebrating her 6th B-Day and she received special treatment which was nice to see. The flight home was actually ahead of schedule and about 75% full. Said my hello to the lady sitting next to me and before I knew it we were up in the air. Smooth flight home. Flight crew were friendly and didn't even charge for cocktails. Nice!

Arrived at Mcaron airport on day of flight. Flight was boarded then cancelled. Was put on next available flight which also was cancelled. Ended up being routed to Sacramento. Then it cost me more money to get from Sacramento to reno than the original ticket cost. Cost me $40.00 roundtrip just to pick up my bag at Reno airport. Total cost between airport food gas mileage etc around $380.00 Original ticket $222.98 . I'm a disabled veteran on a fixed income. I asked for a refund of the original ticket cost. Southwest took five business days to approve the refund no thanks to there customer service center. After five days I had to call the corporate office in Dallas and was lucky enough to get someone on the phone who could at the least push my claim through to approval status. I got every every excuse imaginable from there customer service reps but the one constant was that this was there policy on refunds and I would just have to wait. They took my money immediately out of my account when I bought the ticket so why is so hard for them to put it back. Seriously the IRS processes tax returns faster than Southwest will process a customer refund. As of this posting I still have not received my refund and with a holiday weekend here I guess I'll be lucky to see it by next week. Shame on you Southwest airlines.

"Ontario to Sacramento. This is more of a review on the so called rapid ""reward"" program of Southwest. I fly routinely from Southern California to Sacramento and had built up points to qualify for the ""A"" list of the reward system. I knew I was going to be a little short on the required points but I also had a flight scheduled for the 30th December. I ended up purchasing the tier qualifying points and knew I had the points coming from the flight that was scheduled on the 30th which would have put me way over the needed points. So when I inquired about the status I was told that the flight on the 30th December did not count for 2015 but rather for 2016. When I asked for an explanation I was told something that did not make sense and questioned the person about this that all of a sudden the explanation changed, I then asked for a refund of the tier points that I had purchased as was told ""Sorry but you should have known those were non-refundable? When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told this person who refused to give me his name was the Executive Director of customer relations.

I get terribly motion sick so I have chosen to drive for years. This trip from Charlotte to New Orleans via Houston driving was not an option. I was anxious that I would be sick and miserable the whole flight. Thankfully I was not and the Southwest Airlines crew were friendly and funny. On both legs of the flight we were delayed a bit due to bad weather but the connecting flight waited for the 40 or so passengers to arrive. Unfortunately due to the flight delay our baggage wasn't transferred in time so once we arrived in New Orleans we had to go to the desk and submit a baggage ticket. The women at the desk were patient even though I was about to lose my mind! They located our luggage on the next flight and promptly brought it our hotel and they gave us an airport meal voucher and 2 drink vouchers even though we decided not to wait. The trip back home was just a pleasant and our luggage arrived with us. I will be flying again in 2 weeks and again over the summer on Southwest. I like the reasonable fares and the free baggage but the excellent customer service shown by Southwest will keep me a loyal customer.

"This flight was set to depart about 9:20pm on Dec 28, from Orlando to Birmingham, the first delay was to 10:15 pm and came out about 6:05pm. So they knew they had a problem at 6pm. It appears the problem originated due to the St Louis flight not being able to come into Chicago due to sleet and severe weather, hence the Chicago to Nashville leg of the flight was also delayed. The flight we were scheduled for was to come in from Nashville. Southwest is a point to point airline as I was told by customer service today, (after holding for 90 minutes) which means if a previous leg is delayed or canceled there is no plane to pick you up. So know where your plane is coming from and check its flight status. We were told another plane was being routed from Dallas to Nashville to pick up passengers and come to Orlando to be our plane from Orlando to Birmingham. The delay was again changed from 10:15 to 11:55 then to 12:55 am. A plane did arrive at 12:20 and we were told it was our flight. Only to be told at 12:50 am that the pilot has too many hours and cant fly you to Birmingham after all, so we are now at 12:50 am going to officially cancel the 9:20 pm Flight and we cant get you on another flight till 9:20 pm the next day. My concern in calling customer service was to ask that the process be reviewed in regard to how this flight delay then cancelation was handled as obviously a mistake was made in telling the passengers they had a plane coming with a delayed departure time set for 12:55 am and yet no one in command for Southwest was checking flight hours for the pilots to realize there was no way this flight was leaving Orlando. The customer service rep said she could only report my concerns to management but I did not have the right to ask for an explanation or any admission they had made an error in judgement on when the flight should have been canceled. I just wanted to know they would look into it and determine a better method to communicate flights, delays and pilot and crew travel restrictions so that this type of very avoidable error doesnt happen agsain. Southwest cannot control the weather and they will continue to be a point to point airline operation but get some people who can do math to determine flight hours limitations for pilots and crews in these situations so after a 4.5 hour delay you are not told the flight now has to cancel because of pilot has to many hours to fly. If you are making these types of errors what else is happening behind the scenes? Also I would just like an email from management that they are looking into this for enhancement or correction and wa stold no way your getting any admission from us about why this happened.

"My trip from Phoenix to Chicago this summer aboard Southwest was a 9/10 overall. As soon as we arrived at the airport, we used the check-in next to the parking garage. It was efficient and saved lots of time. At our gate, boarding was in groups. We were in B. We boarded with no trouble. Our plane was a 737-800, with the split scimitar winglets. I loved the plane, and it offered a smooth as can be ride. Beverage service was provided with small cups, but enough to quench my thirst. As usual, Southwest provided peanuts and pretzels. The last time I flew (2013) I was provided 2 bags of pretzels, but this flight I was given crackers and peanuts. The legroom on board was pretty acceptable, normal for a Southwest flight. The landing was the worst part, though. We had to go around to make way for a smaller plane, and as soon as we landed, it was the bumpiest I had experienced.

"Flying out of Las Vegas is often a depressing experience. The airport can be full gamblers who lost, or people sad to see their vacations end. The security line and line for the ticket counters can be infinite. On my flight, there was a gate change about 20 minutes before our flight was to board. This wasn't announced until shortly after we were supposed to board. There was some additional delay in boarding and our flight left about 30 minutes late. On Southwest, there are no assigned seats. I elected for $12 for the advanced check in option, and was assigned slot B5 (which is equivalent to the 65th person to board the aircraft). I had no problem finding a seat I liked, window seat near the front of the plane. There was wifi with about 20 live TV channels available on your own device. One thing I like about Southwest is they do not take themselves that seriously. Humor and a laid back attitude is common among ground staff and flight crew. The crew on my flight were attentive and friendly. Southwest also does not charge a bag or change fee. I booked the lowest fare and my fare went down a few times. I was simply able to change my flight to the current fare and a credit is now in my account to use towards future flights. I do not get my money back per say, but I do not lose it either.

Subsequently, my son who was returning to college the following week was unable to check in for boarding pass since they believed he had not flown the previous week. They wanted $200 more than was quoted on their website during ticketing to get on. My wife spent over 2 hours, including 45 min with a supervisor to no effect. Their response was to call customer relations on Monday morning which is 24 hours after the necessary flight. The bottom line is do not trust or rely on the Southwest Airlines website - it clearly is not accurate and do not expect anyone at Southwest to rectify a situation caused by their incompetence.

"We arrived at Ontario Airport approximately 1 hour before the Southwest Airlines flight was due to depart. Our flight was supposed to depart at 1020 hours with a layover in Sacramento and then landing in Portland, Oregon at 1345 hours. At 0950 hours there was an announcement that the flight would be delayed until 1130 hours. This meant that we would not make it to Sacramento on time for our layover in Portland. We went to the Southwest counter and we were told that the only flight we could get on would mean we would have a four hour layover in San Jose and we wouldn't land in Portland until 1915 hours. I explained to the lady that we needed an earlier flight because we were flying to Portland for a family event that started at 1900 hours. She then told me that there was a flight that landed in Portland at 1805 hours, but that was the earliest. So, we reluctantly took that flight. My Fiancee asked about our luggage. She said that our luggage would be on a direct flight and would land in Portland at 1400 hours. I asked her since the luggage was getting there before us where we would pick it up. She said ""Baggage claim"". I understand where baggage is picked up, I'm not an idiot. I just thought since luggage was getting there sooner we would pick it up in a specific area at baggage claim. She handed me the tickets and told me that was it. I had overheard another customer received vouchers so I asked her if we would receive any vouchers for our trouble. She explained that we did not qualify for any vouchers because our flight landed before 1900 hours. We walked away from that counter upset, and promising we would never fly Southwest Airlines again. Deciding that we needed to do something about the lack of customer service, we got back in line to talk to someone else. When we eventually got to the front of the line we spoke to an agent. He explained to us that the flight we had was the earliest he could find for us. My fiancée then explained that we had not received a voucher or anything for our inconvenience. He then gave us two $200 vouchers for future use. We were still upset, but felt a little better about receiving the vouchers. While we were standing near the counter deciding where to go sit down, we overheard another gentleman being very loud and rude to one of the ladies behind the counter. He was on the same flight as us and was upset about not landing in Portland until late at night. Not only did he get on the same flight as we did, but he also received two $200 vouchers and face value for his ticket. I am sure that delays happen often do to inclement weather or maintenance problems and I understand that those problems are out of Southwest Airlines control. It is just very upsetting that someone that was rude and loud received more for his inconvenience than we did. Did we receive less because we were nice? Getting something for a flight being delayed shouldn't depend on the volume of our voice or the rudeness in our tone. This should be about what Southwest Airlines can do to keep customers and what they can do to apologize for missed family events.

"I commend Southwest Airlines on the exceptional customer service I experienced today. Southwest Airlines actually contacted me by phone regarding an upcoming trip in January from San Juan to Canton /Akron. The flight was moved from the early afternoon to 6:45 am. That would present little issue except that we are arriving in to San Juan on a cruise ship at 8:00 am. and could not make the flight. The representative checked and there were no flights out to CAK the next two days and asked if we could switch airports. We advised that we lived near the CLE airport and they were more than happy to switch for us as long as we were willing to leave from one airport and arrive back at the other. A day later, after discussions with our traveling companions, we decided that it would make more logistical sense to leave from the same airport.

"For the most part, the experience was average. Except, there were a few specific instances in which I was extremely frustrated. 1) There was a delay in our flight (this happens), so we landed as soon as our connecting flight was finishing boarding. We stepped off the first plane (from Las Vegas to Austin), ran to the next gate for the next flight (Austin to DC), and as we arrived they were saying our names over the loudspeaker. We got on the flight and the plane was completely full except for our seats which was fine, however the flight attendants were not very kind, and we all felt that we were blamed for being late. However we have zero control in the matter of the other plane making it to the airport in time for the connecting flight. That was very unsettling, and embarrassing, as this was taking place in front of other passengers. 2) I attempted to connect to the WiFi via Southwest for their entertainment. This is free (yet limited) and there was no warning about that. The connection was also poor, so I decided to spend the $8 on the full-access WiFi. It took me over an hour to connect to this, and I needed certain applications on my phone to watch certain shows which I could set-up until after the flight. Again, there was no warning prior to purchasing that additional applications would be needed. Additionally, the connection was poor and I had to constantly refresh (even after paying), which was extremely frustrating.

They offer no assistance in that event regardless of if it was their fault or not and they will never put you on another airline.

The problem is that they routinely cancel flights 20 minutes before departure because the flight is less than half full and then send you on a later flight 2 or 3 hours later making it impossible to schedule and attend meetings the same day.

"First time traveling with Southwest to PUJ from IAD. On August 15, 2015 I traveled from PUJ to MDW. Before departing the airplane, the pilot informed passengers that all flights to Washington were cancelled and to proceed to ticketing. So once I cleared customs, I went upstairs to the ticketing counter and after spending almost an hour in line, I was told my flight to IAD had been cleared. It was around 4:15pm. So they took my baggage and told me to proceed to the gate. I had to go through security again. After spending over 3 hours at the gate, I was informed again the flight had been cancelled. Customer Service said that Southwest had only two flights to IAD on 8/16 and the flights were full and they could get me on a flight on Tuesday. I understand the issue with air traffic control, however FAA stated computers were back in service at 4 pm on 8/15. Southwest only had three to four flights to IAD and my flight was at 8:55 pm. So with only four flights, Southwest could not get the later flights to IAD out? I'm stuck in an airport on standby but the only thing Southwest say is sorry, it wasn't our fault. Southwest needs to do a better job with its flights and with IAD being a major airport, more flights to and from are needed. Southwest also need to branch out to ORD and contract with other airlines to assist in situations like this.

"I wanted to say Thank you and give super kudos to an employee who worked at the Southwest ticket counter in Atlanta. I never write a review but this was a experience I had to share regarding flight #860 leaving ATL going to SFO. My boyfriend and I fly Southwest all the time, he is usually on a companion pass and I'm usually a reserved ticket. Very few times we've run into overbooked flights and missed connections. I noticed when ever we do hit these bumps in our travel the person at the ticket counter treats his situation totally different from mine. Makes one think - does the type of ticket a traveler has warrant the type of service he/she receives during these traveling hiccups? Any issues I have with my reserved ticket are handled promptly and with a pleasant demeanor. This particular time I was not traveling with my boyfriend and there was a hiccup with the flight. I purposely stayed on the phone while he went from Southwest Airlines employee to employee and every person was rude, and flat out didn't give the type customer service you would expect from one of the most respected airlines. Being at the Atlanta airport from 8:00 am till 4:00 pm and having no luck getting back to San Francisco, I'm sure he was ready to give up. Good thing we held on a little while longer. The ticket agent seemed to not care what type of ticket he had. Her main concern was making sure the customer ended up where he needed to be. Thank you 1,000 times over. I wish I could have been there to speak with someone on the spot.  I only wish that the employees at the ticket counter treated all customers the same and handled their flight hiccups with the utmost professionalism no matter how stressed out they may be and no matter if it's a buddy pass, companion pass or reserved ticket.

"On a recent flight originating from Fort Lauderdale, FL to Richmond, connecting in Atlanta, the plane arrived to the terminal on time and was expected to depart on time. After the incoming passengers exited, the person in charge of boarding made no attempt to load the plane. After a lengthy delay the passengers of flight 1505 were informed that a service technician was addressing a problem and the flight would incur a minor delay. In a confusing and poor miscommunication between the Gate personnel and the gate attendant we were given conflicting and garbled information as to new delays and would be given more updates as soon as the problem was closer to correction. I checked the Arrivals/Departures monitors and saw that numerous incoming and departing Southwest flights were being delayed by hours. Another update around 3 hours later informed us that the scheduled Flight 1505 would not be departing at all. A different plane would be assigned to Fort Lauderdale once it landed from Atlanta. This would be around 10.20 pm. We were finally asked to form a line to make arrangements for whatever Southwest could come up with. My best option was to wait until Monday to get back to Richmond. I tactfully informed the Gate Agent that that was not an option as I had a job to return to. I asked about a flight closer to Richmond, ready to be boarded. I was told that option wasn't available, and there was nothing left. Finally I asked if another flight could get us closer to Richmond, and a rental car be provided to drive the remaining distance. Again, nothing but the travel vouchers were offered. Then a option to book a flight to BWI was available, arriving at 2.00 am. No hotels were available. I again asked about car rental. I was informed Southwest didn't offer or would pay for a rental. No other airline was available either, seems SW doesn't work with anyone else either.

"Traveled with spouse, daughter-in-law, and 18 month old grandchild. Purchased tickets for the adults in February, paying extra for early boarding. Daughter-in-law decided she wanted to purchase a ticket for her child and have her sit in an airline approved car seat on plane, instead of on her lap. Agent told her not to bother paying the early boarding fee when she purchased her child's ticket as the child would be boarding with her mother. My daughter-in-law traveled this way with her child several times on Southwest without a problem. However, at Fort Lauderdale, when she attempted to board the aircraft with her child, the agent told her that even though her ticket listed her boarding group as A23, her baby's ticket said boarding group C and she would have to wait for that group to be called! During the heated discussion that followed, several passengers behind us boarded the aircraft. Finally she was permitted on the aircraft. My husband went to sit in the seat across the aisle from us and was told that seat was taken. Another passenger claimed he was saving several seats (I believe it was 6) for his family. The flight attendant was standing just one row away and was aware of this behavior. My husband ended up sitting behind us. A woman who sat in the window seat near him plopped her bags on the seat and said to leave them there as she did not want to have anyone sit in the middle seat. It appears to me that Southwest needs to revise its seating procedure! If you have paid an extra fee for priority boarding you are entitled to board according to the status printed on your ticket. If your family members( who are not young children) have not paid for priority boarding, you should not be able to block passengers from claiming a seat for which they have paid an extra priority boarding fee. If you are unhappy if someone wants to claim a middle seat, too bad! You should be forced to sit there instead. The same goes for all the baggage folks drag on the plane. Half of the passengers look like they are fleeing a war ravaged land carrying on huge bags or multiple bags.

"Rude staff disorganized boarding misinformation about boarding procedures packed in like rats in the smallest seat space I've seen.

I flew SWA from Tampa to Baltimore in April. It went well except for the boarding. We were delayed leaving because at the end of boarding one passenger didn't get a seat. That was because their system is not assigned seating it's open seating so nobody has a particular seat and nobody can prove which seat they are entitled to. From the announcements that followed it appeared that the problem was the lap babies-ones that were given free or low fares because they were supposed to be kept on their mother's lap (is that safe?). There were a lot of children on this flight. Apparently one of the mothers decided to give her child a seat instead taking up a paying passenger's seat. Without any way to prove which mother was the culprit the poor lady without a seat was given something they called an emergency seat. It didn't sound like it was very comfortable. If you fly SW do get priority boarding or you could end up in a seat like that.,,Economy Class,,,no,i flew swa from tampa to baltimore in april it went well except for the boarding we were delayed leaving because at the end of boarding one passenger didnt get a seat that was because their system is not assigned seating its open seating so nobody has a particular seat and nobody can prove which seat they are entitled to from the announcements that followed it appeared that the problem was the lap babiesones that were given free or low fares because they were supposed to be kept on their mothers lap is that safe there were a lot of children on this flight apparently one of the mothers decided to give her child a seat instead taking up a paying passengers seat without any way to prove which mother was the culprit the poor lady without a seat was given something they called an emergency seat it didnt sound like it was very comfortable if you fly sw do get priority boarding or you could end up in a seat like that,flew swa tampa baltimore april went well except boarding delayed leaving end boarding one passenger didnt get seat system assigned seating open seating nobody particular seat nobody prove seat entitled announcements followed appeared problem lap babiesones given free low fares supposed kept mothers lap safe lot children flight apparently one mothers decided give child seat instead taking paying passengers seat without way prove mother culprit poor lady without seat given something called emergency seat didnt sound like comfortable fly sw get priority boarding could end seat like,NEU

I have had the worst experience with Southwest Airlines. My plane was initially supposed to board at 7.15 pm and departure at 7.45 however we did not start boarding until 7.50. Once on the plane we waited 20 minutes to depart but then the captain spoke informed us that the plane had been fuelled with too much fuel so we were going to have to wait 15 minutes for the de-fuelling process. After 25 minutes a Southwest Airlines representative came on the loud speaker apologized and informed us that the de-fuelling process would take about 70-90 minutes - not 15.

SWA 737-700 IND-RSW March 21st. We booked Southwest airlines Wanna Get Away for a very cheap price so we could sit together we paid for early bird check in and we were in Group B.

I have been traveling business select with Southwest twice a month for the past 3 years. I pay the extra money so I can board first to get my preferred window seat up close to the front on the Port side of the plane in order to quickly un-board either for another connection flight or to get on the road. My question is how can you rightfully sell a business select ticket when knowingly that there will be 40 people left on that plane during a connection which all 40 people will most always move forward after the un-boarding taking up most of the preferred seating area. Another question: I flew in on flight 2230 from New Orleans to San Antonio there was supposed to be no plane change in Dallas. Once we arrived in Dallas and everyone un-loaded except for the ones of us that were continuing on to S.A. Then we were told to get off and go to the next gate that there was another flight going to S.A. After several of us asked what was going on because of the plane change and the much later departure time of this flight (we never received an answer) then an hour later they announce that they are now waiting on another flight with 90 more people. This plane change and departure delay then became obvious there were no weather or mechanical issues they were combining 3 San Antonio flights into one to probably save fuel and personnel cost at the expense of their customer.,,Economy Class,,,yes,i have been traveling business select with southwest twice a month for the past 3 years i pay the extra money so i can board first to get my preferred window seat up close to the front on the port side of the plane in order to quickly unboard either for another connection flight or to get on the road my question is how can you rightfully sell a business select ticket when knowingly that there will be 40 people left on that plane during a connection which all 40 people will most always move forward after the unboarding taking up most of the preferred seating area another question i flew in on flight 2230 from new orleans to san antonio there was supposed to be no plane change in dallas once we arrived in dallas and everyone unloaded except for the ones of us that were continuing on to sa then we were told to get off and go to the next gate that there was another flight going to sa after several of us asked what was going on because of the plane change and the much later departure time of this flight we never received an answer then an hour later they announce that they are now waiting on another flight with 90 more people this plane change and departure delay then became obvious there were no weather or mechanical issues they were combining 3 san antonio flights into one to probably save fuel and personnel cost at the expense of their customer,traveling business select southwest twice month past 3 years pay extra money board first get preferred window seat close front port side plane order quickly unboard either another connection flight get road question rightfully sell business select ticket knowingly 40 people left plane connection 40 people always move forward unboarding taking preferred seating area another question flew flight 2230 new orleans san antonio supposed plane change dallas arrived dallas everyone unloaded except ones us continuing sa told get go next gate another flight going sa several us asked going plane change much later departure time flight never received answer hour later announce waiting another flight 90 people plane change departure delay became obvious weather mechanical issues combining 3 san antonio flights one probably save fuel personnel cost expense customer,NEU
The worst airline I have flown. San Diego to Vegas Friday 13th Feb. At check-in told there is no allocated seating. Nowhere to sit in departure lounge hardly anywhere to stand.

We accepted it and boarded sat at the rear of the cabin but luckily sitting together no room in overhead lockers so glad we had checked bag in. Never come across such an untidy cabin crew.

Traveled with Southwest for the first and definitely last time. They are OK if there are no weather emergencies or other issues: that is how our flight from LaGuardia to Denver CO went. They only failed to announce when passengers with small children can board however we managed to be seated together. Staff service was good otherwise the captain for that flight was excellent. We landed as scheduled baggage was out in no wait. On our way back things got out of hand. The notification about cancelled flight came in too late that could offer only flight to East coast to Dulles in Washington DC and that's your problem how you get to your destination (NY greater area). OK can understand they are not responsible for the weather. We got on the flight to Dulles airport. However Dulles control tower had an incident and flight was diverted to the Baltimore airport (which was supposed to be not accepting Southwest airplanes). We waited three hours there to be refuelled and yes you can get out but for your baggage Southwest carries no responsibility. Not a weather related issue now. They claim no responsibility for the baggage. We could not afford a time to travel back 4-5 hours to Dulles airport from NY to retrieve our bags and had to wait. Got there about 2.30 am car rental with our reservation was closed had to spend more time and money for another rental not to mention the long drive to NYC after extra long trip from Denver. I would say that Southwest staff tries their best in the strict company policy limits.

"Tampa FL to Phoenix AZ on 2/5. Don't waste your money on the extra $25.00 per ticket for each travel day to have Early Bird check in. It is a total waste of money. For our first flight from Tampa FL to Phoenix on 2/5/15 I paid the extra $25 for each ticket and our position in line was A59 and A60. That is supposed to mean that 58 people ahead of us also paid the extra $25 to have expedited boarding. On the return Southwest Flight from Phoenix to Tampa on 2/10 our positions in line were B26 and B27. When I asked the ticket agent at 2 different locations why our boarding passes were so far back I was told that it has to do with: 1) the number of people on the flight (there were 175 people on the flight) so I was told that at least half of them selected the Early Bird check in option. 2) when I got online to purchase my fare tickets and what the fare was (I purchased our tickets on 12/15/14 with the ""Wanna get away"" fare). 3) when I got online to pre-board (I did this exactly 24 hours ahead of boarding time). So to be the 119th person of 175 people on board this plane at least 118 people paid the Early Bird fee? No I asked the people ahead of us in line and they had not paid the extra $25 per ticket per flight. I also asked some of the people in the A line and they had not purchased the Early Bird option.

I flew from Richmond to Fort Myers by way of Atlanta. I was boarded and the problems began. Plane was supposed to leave at 4.25. After 30 minutes of waiting they told the passengers that an outside compartment was stuck open. Had to call maintenance in. Over an hour delay we took off. I asked flight attendant about my transfer in Atlanta she snipped back check at the gate. Got to the gate to find out my connecting plane was already boarding.

"I recently took a trip from Albany to Orlando and thoroughly enjoyed it. Although the boarding process is a little strange as long as you check in on time there is a very good chance that you will find good seats even if you are traveling with family members. I got B27 because I checked in a little late but I was still able to get a window seat over the wing like I wanted. And since I only brought a suitcase and a small duffel bag I didn't have to check any luggage which is free for two bags anyway. I am 5' 3"" and small but I imagine that someone much taller and larger would still be as comfortable as I was in the seats. The planes were very clean and the staff were very welcoming and enthusiastic especially on the way down to Orlando. The flight attendants are quite funny during the safety briefing and manage to make you feel as if you are listening to a human being instead of a monotonous robot. They were also sympathetic when our flight back to Albany from Baltimore was delayed about an hour and our gate was switched twice and the captain addressed us personally to apologize. As all three of my flights were less than 3 hours each I didn't order anything but the complimentary snacks were a nice touch. Although each plane I flew on was wifi-equipped I did not purchase it but I did use the free flight tracker. Overall Southwest offered outstanding service and comfort at a lower price than most other airlines that I have flown on.

Recently my wife and I had a round-trip to Jamaica. Our flight 1042 from Chicago on Dec 26 was delayed 1.5 hrs because one of the lavatories was found non-operational. However the crew learned about it after all passengers had boarded the plane. Boarding started on time on the way back from Montego Bay however after a third of all passengers had boarded the crew found out that 3 seats were non-operational. The flight (Jan 2nd #1043) was oversold. It took a while to find 3 passengers who agreed to take another flight by delaying their return to Chicago.

We flew round trip from Baltimore Washington International to Aruba on December 22 2014. We arrived at 6am for our 8.45 am flight and the lines were long for check in. Curbside check in was not any better. The International line was shorter so we were able to process through in a reasonable amount of time. It was a nice flight with no problems. For our return trip the hotel staff recommended that we get to the airport three hours early. The check in process was very well handled and we even went through the United States Customs before boarding the plane. This made it very easy when we arrived in Baltimore to grab our luggage and go. The return flight had the best flight crew I have ever flown with. The attitude and customer service skills made this flight very enjoyable.

"My family my husband and I and our two children ages 11 and 14 are well seasoned travelers. We live in the NY area and fly out of LaGuardia several times a year. We know LaGuardia is a busy and cramped airport and deal with it. This weekend was the first time we've ever flown Southwest. Southwest is the worst airline we have been on. Who came up with no assigned seating? We were traveling with my 88 year old mother in law who had to stand in ""line B"" while we were in ""line a"". We had to take her luggage because she was not in our seating group and she isn't strong enough to get her suitcase in the overhead bin or savvy enough to pull a suitcase down a cramped aisle. There were no guarantees that my family of five that spend well over $1000 for our flights (in total) were even going to be seated together. Our 11 year old son has anxiety issues and likes to sit by a window when we fly. I never book a flight unless I can see the seating chart and pick our seats before I pay for the flight. This wasn't even an option for us. So I was anxious because I was afraid we would be stuck in separate seats. I had to set my alarm on my phone so I remembered to check in exactly 24 hours in advance so we could secure a good seating assignment. Our flight out of LaGuardia was a nightmare! There's nowhere to sit in the terminal by the gate. So my 88 year old mother in law had to stand until we boarded. There were no TV monitors on telling us when we were going to board. We had been standing in line for about twenty minutes before we realized there wasn't even a plane at the gate. And they had customers singing over the loud speakers as entertainment. They never announced when we were going to start boarding. And once on the plane we sat on the ground for an hour and a half and the pilot never came on and told us we had a delay and how long it was going to be.

My husband and I both fly frequently between Ohio and New York and Florida so this review is based on many flights. Southwest has become my preferred airline.

I love flying Southwest but the reason why I fly other airlines is do to the very slow baggage claim at Love Field. I took a flight from Cleveland to Love Field #4221 October 11 2014. It took one hour from the time our flight landed until the bags were delivered. One hour I could not believe it. They build that nice building but have no way of telling passages which of the four baggage carousels your bags will be delivered on so people scurry from one to another looking. Even after the bags arrive the Southwest team member usually is to busy to announce baggage drop until 4 or 5 bags have arrived.

My family and I traveled last spring from Akron to Tampa on Airtran / Southwest Airlines. When we arrived at the airport the flight was delayed due to mechanical failure for 2 hours. Original posted delay turned into multiple delays promised another plane which didn't show when expected. 8 hours later we were still waiting. Our patience as well as the entire waiting crowd was gone. The staff at the gate were authorized to reimburse passengers with certificate travel for the inconvenience. Ok great (we thought). I have tried to use our certificates in several different ways. 1) We had already purchased tickets for a trip later in the summer (same airline) asked if we could cancel those and use the certificates NO. 2) Asked if we could use the certificates for additional family members to travel with us NO. 3) Tried to book a flight for another trip sorry certificate seats sold out. 4) Tried to book again on a different date NO because that put us past the travel dates on the certificate. 5) Last try today and told that the certificates are expired and no longer valid.

"I was a loyal Southwest customer who hadn't flown in a while. After five flights within the same week all I can say is Southwest isn't what it used to be. For a 6'5"" 200 lb person the new seats are sheer torture. And on every flight I encountered too many passengers being crammed in to too-small planes. It's no surprise that every logistic being run on such a razor's edge makes for a stressful experience. God help you if you have to endure any connecting flights. The schedules are so tight now that they have no time to even clean the planes between boardings and there are lots of delays. What a terrible atmosphere we encountered. The staff tries their best to pretend they aren't running a grim cattle drive but no one is fooled.

"I will never fly Southwest again. They claim there is no assigned seating but you can purchase ""Early Bird Check- in"" which they claim automatically checks you in 36 hours in advance instead of the usual 24 hours. So I purchased the Early Bird check in plan thinking that my whole family would be able to sit together. (Group A-so I thought). Surprise when I received my boarding passes we were in Group B which means you have less that a 50% chance of your family seating together. I called Southwest and was told that the Early Bird Check in does not guarantee anything it just gives you the best available boarding at that time Well they didn't tell me this when they took my money. So in order to ensure that my family would be together I had to spend more money and purchase First-In boarding passes (Group A) for an additional $40 per person (One way). The plane was small cramped no room to even think about being comfortable. I am an average size man (5'11 195 lbs). I can't imagine how someone bigger must have felt. Then imagine my surprise when the flight attendant announced to the final group of people boarding (Group C) to take the first available seat because they were saving the seats in the back for families so they could sit with their children. Twice I spent money to guarantee my family would sit together because they claim there is no assigned seating and now they are saving seats for families so they can sit together Are they serious!! Either you have assigned seating or you don't. Which is it? It is clear that Southwest doesn't have their act together and I believe they are not worth the hassle.

"I recently flew with Southwest. I was extremely disappointed in the dysfunctional boarding system. Although I was aware that the Southwest boarding system was different I had no idea how poorly it could work in reality. Long story short: whatever you do do not pay extra for a business select ticket. I needed to travel within the last few weeks from St Louis International airport to Washington Dulles International airport. I would have preferred a direct flight but being able to stow both carryon bags without using gate check is a big plus. In order to get a better seat on the airplane I paid the extra money for a business select ticket. This puts you near the front if not at the front of the line. Southwest seating is first come first serve. On my way to D.C. the system worked well enough although on my first flight I did not get a great seat as I was boarding in position A15. That didn't bother me much the system had worked as designed. My second flight I was first in line and pretty content with the outcome. However on one of my return flights things got extremely frustrating. The problem started when it was time to board after a layover at Midway airport in Chicago. Now I first want to say that I support the idea of allowing people who are handicapped to pre-board. But I do not support the idea of letting them take all the best seats on the plane. My ticket from Midway to St Louis had me boarding in position A1 theoretically the very first passenger to board if not for pre-boarding. There were four pre-board passengers ahead of me. When the gate agent called for pre-boarding around six more family members who were clearly strong healthy adults decided to board with them. Not acceptable. By the time I got on the plane all of the very best seats with extra leg room in the front row where taken. The four very best seats where occupied by the healthy family members who decided that they were entitled to board with their handicapped family members. Why can't Southwest declare the front row an ""exit row""? It is an exit row! That would prevent pre-boarders from sitting there. What did I pay extra for to get priority seating if Southwest is just going to give those seats away to some very dishonest people? In the end: I paid and they did not deliver. I recommend that if you choose to fly Southwest do not pay extra for the business select ticket. I personally will not be flying Southwest again under any circumstances.",,Economy Class,,,no,i recently flew with southwest i was extremely disappointed in the dysfunctional boarding system although i was aware that the southwest boarding system was different i had no idea how poorly it could work in reality long story short whatever you do do not pay extra for a business select ticket i needed to travel within the last few weeks from st louis international airport to washington dulles international airport i would have preferred a direct flight but being able to stow both carryon bags without using gate check is a big plus in order to get a better seat on the airplane i paid the extra money for a business select ticket this puts you near the front if not at the front of the line southwest seating is first come first serve on my way to dc the system worked well enough although on my first flight i did not get a great seat as i was boarding in position a15 that didnt bother me much the system had worked as designed my second flight i was first in line and pretty content with the outcome however on one of my return flights things got extremely frustrating the problem started when it was time to board after a layover at midway airport in chicago now i first want to say that i support the idea of allowing people who are handicapped to preboard but i do not support the idea of letting them take all the best seats on the plane my ticket from midway to st louis had me boarding in position a1 theoretically the very first passenger to board if not for preboarding there were four preboard passengers ahead of me when the gate agent called for preboarding around six more family members who were clearly strong healthy adults decided to board with them not acceptable by the time i got on the plane all of the very best seats with extra leg room in the front row where taken the four very best seats where occupied by the healthy family members who decided that they were entitled to board with their handicapped family members why cant southwest declare the front row an exit row it is an exit row that would prevent preboarders from sitting there what did i pay extra for to get priority seating if southwest is just going to give those seats away to some very dishonest people in the end i paid and they did not deliver i recommend that if you choose to fly southwest do not pay extra for the business select ticket i personally will not be flying southwest again under any circumstances,recently flew southwest extremely disappointed dysfunctional boarding system although aware southwest boarding system different idea poorly could work reality long story short whatever pay extra business select ticket needed travel within last weeks st louis international airport washington dulles international airport would preferred direct flight able stow carryon bags without using gate check big plus order get better seat airplane paid extra money business select ticket puts near front front line southwest seating first come first serve way dc system worked well enough although first flight get great seat boarding position a15 didnt bother much system worked designed second flight first line pretty content outcome however one return flights things got extremely frustrating problem started time board layover midway airport chicago first want say support idea allowing people handicapped preboard support idea letting take best seats plane ticket midway st louis boarding position a1 theoretically first passenger board preboarding four preboard passengers ahead gate agent called preboarding around six family members clearly strong healthy adults decided board acceptable time got plane best seats extra leg room front row taken four best seats occupied healthy family members decided entitled board handicapped family members cant southwest declare front row exit row exit row would prevent preboarders sitting pay extra get priority seating southwest going give seats away dishonest people end paid deliver recommend choose fly southwest pay extra business select ticket personally flying southwest circumstances,NEG
"I was hesitant to fly Southwest because I'd heard the ""cattle call"" remarks from others but honestly it was fine. I paid the $25 for my sister and I to do the early bird check-in which I will always do from now on. We boarded quickly and took off on time. I enjoyed sitting up front on the way to Phoenix (I'm claustrophobic so the extra room made for a more comfortable feeling overall). Coming back we were a few rows back and it was cramped for sure. That's to be expected on a smaller jet with smaller seats. For a domestic flight it's doable. What I was really impressed with was the overall attitude and presence of the crew. I have always flown Delta in the past and was surprised to see the pilots before the flight. The flight attendants were very nice.

August 16 flight 74 Indianapolis to Orlando. In great contrast to our August 11 trip from Orlando to Indianapolis (Flt 4453) that provided the usual friendly service from Southwest attendants our experience today was the exact opposite. Upon boarding our experience was very positive with the attendant who seated us and helped with storing our carry-ons. We never saw that person again since she must have been working the back of the plane. The attendants in the front of the plane (a male and female) did their job and that was about it - bare minimum. From the outset when we boarded they seemed to lack interest were detached and somewhat edgy. I noted the male attendant was unnecessary rude to two male passengers when he could have been much more polite in both verbal exchanges that I overheard.,,Economy Class,,,yes,august 16 flight 74 indianapolis to orlando in great contrast to our august 11 trip from orlando to indianapolis flt 4453 that provided the usual friendly service from southwest attendants our experience today was the exact opposite upon boarding our experience was very positive with the attendant who seated us and helped with storing our carryons we never saw that person again since she must have been working the back of the plane the attendants in the front of the plane a male and female did their job and that was about it  bare minimum from the outset when we boarded they seemed to lack interest were detached and somewhat edgy i noted the male attendant was unnecessary rude to two male passengers when he could have been much more polite in both verbal exchanges that i overheard,august 16 flight 74 indianapolis orlando great contrast august 11 trip orlando indianapolis flt 4453 provided usual friendly service southwest attendants experience today exact opposite upon boarding experience positive attendant seated us helped storing carryons never saw person since must working back plane attendants front plane male female job bare minimum outset boarded seemed lack interest detached somewhat edgy noted male attendant unnecessary rude two male passengers could much polite verbal exchanges overheard,NEU
My wife and I are from Australia but when we come to the States we try to fly Southwest whenever practical because they deserve the business due to their fair business practices and good service. We've always appreciated that they don't charge for luggage and that a person can change flights without any charge.

We will continue to support them in the future when we come to the States and I wish they operated here in Australia.,,Economy Class,,,no,my wife and i are from australia but when we come to the states we try to fly southwest whenever practical because they deserve the business due to their fair business practices and good service weve always appreciated that they dont charge for luggage and that a person can change flights without any charge we flew them a number of times last month and i can say only good things about them we will continue to support them in the future when we come to the states and i wish they operated here in australia,wife australia come states try fly southwest whenever practical deserve business due fair business practices good service weve always appreciated dont charge luggage person change flights without charge flew number times last month say good things continue support future come states wish operated australia,POS

I heard last week that Southwest is the largest airline in the US now. Unfortunately I think their growth has resulted in decreased novelty and satisfaction. I do fly it on a regular basis because they service MDW from LAX but I find that the amount of space for seats is poor the wifi is the worst that I have found in the market in recent years (I work a lot on planes and SW wifi is very very slow).

Currently on board the plane traveling from Chicago to San Diego using the wifi I purchased for a whopping $8.00. Aside from being able to access a few sites on my iPad (ironically this is one of them) the wifi enabled me to do virtually nothing. I could not open my Netflix/HBO app because they were incapable of connecting to the network so I tried their respective online websites to access my media. Once again the websites were unable to load due to the wifi and I found myself soon discovering more and more entertainment related websites/apps (games/music/etc.) were unable to load. Apparently their definition of wifi limits you to reading Wikipedia articles and twiddling your thumbs while you constantly refresh pages.

I booked a trip to fly from Houston to Lubbock with a stop in Austin. The flight went smoothly from Houston to Austin in Austin I had a 2 hour stopover until my flight to Lubbock I fell asleep and missed my flight and when I went to the gate agent saying that I missed my flight she just shrugged and showed me two boarding passes and said I could get on a flight to Lubbock via Dallas I accepted and she gave me the boarding pass. The flight to Dallas kept getting delayed because of thunderstorms in Dallas. I finally got to Lubbock at 10.50.

It is too bad the people that seem to post on the web are the ones that have had poor experiences. I fly almost weekly on Southwest for the last 6 years. It is with trepidation that I fly other airlines as you never know what you are going to get-especially Delta. The customer service is second to none and the seats are always roomy and predictable. Unless you need the extra leg room such as an exit row if you check in at the 24 hour mark or pay the low fee to board early you have a large selection of seats. Rarely are they late. The staff are empowered to solve customer issues and do so readily. Airline tickets are easy to change and credit refund with no fees. Plus there is no baggage fee for the first 2 bags and their pricing is competitive. Airline miles are so easy to use including international. This airline develops trust based on their reliability and customer service. Definitely a loyal fan and steady customer!,,Economy Class,,,no,it is too bad the people that seem to post on the web are the ones that have had poor experiences i fly almost weekly on southwest for the last 6 years it is with trepidation that i fly other airlines as you never know what you are going to getespecially delta the customer service is second to none and the seats are always roomy and predictable unless you need the extra leg room such as an exit row if you check in at the 24 hour mark or pay the low fee to board early you have a large selection of seats rarely are they late the staff are empowered to solve customer issues and do so readily airline tickets are easy to change and credit refund with no fees plus there is no baggage fee for the first 2 bags and their pricing is competitive airline miles are so easy to use including international this airline develops trust based on their reliability and customer service definitely a loyal fan and steady customer,bad people seem post web ones poor experiences fly almost weekly southwest last 6 years trepidation fly airlines never know going getespecially delta customer service second none seats always roomy predictable unless need extra leg room exit row check 24 hour mark pay low fee board early large selection seats rarely late staff empowered solve customer issues readily airline tickets easy change credit refund fees plus baggage fee first 2 bags pricing competitive airline miles easy use including international airline develops trust based reliability customer service definitely loyal fan steady customer,NEG
"FLL to MSP and return. Staff must've taken how to not smile and treat everyone like cattle as part of their classes because on every flight we took (there were 4 total for the round trip) all attendants were almost disgruntled employees. They looked like they ""had"" to be there. An elderly woman who couldn't sit with her young grandchild who was very nervous about that (because of their no assigned seats policy) was delighted when another customer volunteered to switch seats with her before they even started the seat belt instructions and the first flight attendant reprimanded them and then I saw her tell the second attendant who rolled her eyes. Come on that made the flight more enjoyable for everyone plus what was the big deal to them? Our soft drinks took almost the whole flight to get to us and then they ask for your garbage right after you start drinking it.

My husband took a flight to go to a funeral in Charlotte NC this past month. The flight down was fine the flight back however was a nightmare! They canceled the flight with no prior warning and did nothing to help their passengers from being stranded in the airport. In fact the customer service representative was horrendous. When I called to try to fix the problem she not only had no sympathy for the stress they were causing their customers but she also laughed at me when I was voicing my concerns about the fact that the only flight she was offering us was for Wednesday and his original flight was for Monday. The only solution she had was either take the Wednesday flight and figure out a place to stay for 2 nights or they will refund our ticket price (not the fees included with the ticket) and we were tasked with finding another flight with a different airline to get home. Southwest has no issue with leaving their customers stranded in an airport with no alternative plan than to find your own way home.

Went on vacation July 9-18. Flight out to Denver was ok - nothing special. Seats were very cramped. Flight 2068 back from Denver to Boston was horrible! To start flight was delayed twice. We were a party of 4 sitting all the way in the back. From the time we got in the air until about three quarters of the way through the flight the two female flight attendants and one male flight attendant were just horrible. When one of the females came around asking for beverage requests I asked for a coffee. Everyone in my party received their drink except me no coffee. But it got worse! After drinks were served these three attendants proceeded to stand in the back by the bathroom and galley and talk and laugh extremely loudly with no regard whatsoever for all of us in the back of the plane including two toddlers who were trying to sleep. They kept up their loud talking and shrieking laughter for over an hour. It was absolutely horrible and disrespectful.

When and if Southwest changes its seating policy I will consider flying it again. Unfortunately is pretty much the only airline that flies to ISP but I hate the seating policy so much that for my upcoming trip I will fly into JFK and take a shuttle. SW likes to say that its seating policy is freedom of choice choose any seat you want but that is not true. There is a hierarchy for seating which they charge extra for and then after paying all these extra fees you could still wind up with a lousy seat. We paid extra and were able to snag bulkhead but not exit row for the first leg of our trip because those were taken by mostly short people who don't need the leg room but who had boarded first. Then we had to change planes. Unfortunately the connecting flight originated from somewhere else and the plane was already half full so not only could we not get any leg room but we couldn't even sit together. Paying extra for better boarding is like playing roulette you take your chances and the odds are against you. I'd rather pay extra to choose my seat and know that it is guaranteed. The whole boarding process is so stressful because some people are pushing to get ahead of other people and everyone is rushing to grab the seat they want not knowing if they are going to be out of luck or not. Then after you get your seat the flight attendants are trying to get people to volunteer to give it up so a family can sit together. The whole thing is absurd. On top of all of this their prices are often not the lowest. I can fly into JFK pay extra for premium seating and afford a shuttle for what a Southwest flight to ISP costs.,,Economy Class,,,yes,when and if southwest changes its seating policy i will consider flying it again unfortunately is pretty much the only airline that flies to isp but i hate the seating policy so much that for my upcoming trip i will fly into jfk and take a shuttle sw likes to say that its seating policy is freedom of choice choose any seat you want but that is not true there is a hierarchy for seating which they charge extra for and then after paying all these extra fees you could still wind up with a lousy seat we paid extra and were able to snag bulkhead but not exit row for the first leg of our trip because those were taken by mostly short people who dont need the leg room but who had boarded first then we had to change planes unfortunately the connecting flight originated from somewhere else and the plane was already half full so not only could we not get any leg room but we couldnt even sit together paying extra for better boarding is like playing roulette you take your chances and the odds are against you id rather pay extra to choose my seat and know that it is guaranteed the whole boarding process is so stressful because some people are pushing to get ahead of other people and everyone is rushing to grab the seat they want not knowing if they are going to be out of luck or not then after you get your seat the flight attendants are trying to get people to volunteer to give it up so a family can sit together the whole thing is absurd on top of all of this their prices are often not the lowest i can fly into jfk pay extra for premium seating and afford a shuttle for what a southwest flight to isp costs,southwest changes seating policy consider flying unfortunately pretty much airline flies isp hate seating policy much upcoming trip fly jfk take shuttle sw likes say seating policy freedom choice choose seat want true hierarchy seating charge extra paying extra fees could still wind lousy seat paid extra able snag bulkhead exit row first leg trip taken mostly short people dont need leg room boarded first change planes unfortunately connecting flight originated somewhere else plane already half full could get leg room couldnt even sit together paying extra better boarding like playing roulette take chances odds id rather pay extra choose seat know guaranteed whole boarding process stressful people pushing get ahead people everyone rushing grab seat want knowing going luck get seat flight attendants trying get people volunteer give family sit together whole thing absurd top prices often lowest fly jfk pay extra premium seating afford shuttle southwest flight isp costs,NEG

SJC to PDX. I have never experienced such poor Customer Service in the 13 years I have been traveling with this airline.

Despite having a huge incentive voucher from Alaska Airlines I will say that after this experience I have completely given up on Southwest Airlines as a competitor. I was greeted by a Customer Service Representative with a mouthful of French Fry! After being told that my flight was delayed four hours due to an earlier mechanical problem. I asked why I was not notified prior to my on time arrival at the airport? The representative said that due to operational irregularities there was no way of notifying passengers of the delay. After waiting four hours with no communication form Southwest employees an announcement was made. My flight was going to be canceled and we could all receive vouchers. The chaos that ensued was unreal. Before I knew what was happening there was a line of 100 plus passengers waiting to get vouchers.

My daughters were competing in Orlando Florida. My wife scheduled an 8.30 am flight 3 months ago to make sure to be there. Right after the passengers boarded the flight the pilot announced to passengers that there was a problem with the plane. The passengers deplaned and were told that SW was working on getting another plane a direct flight. There was no direct flight offered and after being told they would be leaving at 5 different times SW finally decided to bump the 3pm flight for the 8.30 am passengers. For all my wife's troubles she was given a measly $200 voucher.

"Southwest's Boarding Process has gotten completely out of control. I haven't flown on Southwest in about a year but my experience on a recent round-trip from Phoenix to Boston with connections proved repeatedly how flyers are abusing Southwest's boarding process. On the first leg I was assigned B38 since I did not pay for EarlyBird seating although I did check in exactly 24 hours before the flight. By the time they got to B31-60 practically the entire flight had boarded. At least 20 people were in the pre-board category about 5 A-list flyers who hadn't gotten an A number boarded after all the A's were called and then another 26 people boarded during ""families and children"". There were less than 30 people remaining to board the plane (which was entirely full) by the time they got to the B31-60 category - when technically there should have been 75-90 people left to board. This experience was repeated on all four flights and was worse when leaving BWI when a group of ""C"" pass holders snuck into the B segment and were not stopped by the gate agent. The final straw was the flight from Chicago to Phoenix. I watched a family walking through the airport to check-in at which point the parents asked for a wheelchair for their young daughter - who had been walking with them up to that point. A wheelchair was commandeered and they were expedited through the TSA check-point. Lo and behold when I arrived at my gate weren't they there - and with a pre-board pass. So clearly another way to bypass Southwest's procedures is just to commandeer a wheelchair and then you get to pre-board. It really is time for Southwest to just start assigning seats; the flying public it has been demonstrated will otherwise continue to outmanoeuvre and get around the ""rules.""",,Economy Class,,,no,southwests boarding process has gotten completely out of control i havent flown on southwest in about a year but my experience on a recent roundtrip from phoenix to boston with connections proved repeatedly how flyers are abusing southwests boarding process on the first leg i was assigned b38 since i did not pay for earlybird seating although i did check in exactly 24 hours before the flight by the time they got to b3160 practically the entire flight had boarded at least 20 people were in the preboard category about 5 alist flyers who hadnt gotten an a number boarded after all the as were called and then another 26 people boarded during families and children there were less than 30 people remaining to board the plane which was entirely full by the time they got to the b3160 category  when technically there should have been 7590 people left to board this experience was repeated on all four flights and was worse when leaving bwi when a group of c pass holders snuck into the b segment and were not stopped by the gate agent the final straw was the flight from chicago to phoenix i watched a family walking through the airport to checkin at which point the parents asked for a wheelchair for their young daughter  who had been walking with them up to that point a wheelchair was commandeered and they were expedited through the tsa checkpoint lo and behold when i arrived at my gate werent they there  and with a preboard pass so clearly another way to bypass southwests procedures is just to commandeer a wheelchair and then you get to preboard it really is time for southwest to just start assigning seats the flying public it has been demonstrated will otherwise continue to outmanoeuvre and get around the rules,southwests boarding process gotten completely control havent flown southwest year experience recent roundtrip phoenix boston connections proved repeatedly flyers abusing southwests boarding process first leg assigned b38 since pay earlybird seating although check exactly 24 hours flight time got b3160 practically entire flight boarded least 20 people preboard category 5 alist flyers hadnt gotten number boarded called another 26 people boarded families children less 30 people remaining board plane entirely full time got b3160 category technically 7590 people left board experience repeated four flights worse leaving bwi group c pass holders snuck b segment stopped gate agent final straw flight chicago phoenix watched family walking airport checkin point parents asked wheelchair young daughter walking point wheelchair commandeered expedited tsa checkpoint lo behold arrived gate werent preboard pass clearly another way bypass southwests procedures commandeer wheelchair get preboard really time southwest start assigning seats flying public demonstrated otherwise continue outmanoeuvre get around rules,NEG
"We planned a trip from Pittsburgh Airport to Memphis Airport (supposed to be a 4hr 45min trip). We were traveling with a 3 yr old. We arrived at Pittsburgh Airport with our flight scheduled to leave at 6.30pm when checking in they said that our flight was delayed due to bad weather and offered to move us to a flight leaving at 4.45pm we agreed and actually made it in time to board. Once it was our turn to board we were told our boarding passes were not valid and had to get out of line to go back to the lady at the boarding counter to receive new boarding tickets. We finally boarded the plane and eventually made it to our first lay-over at Chicago Airport. Ended up waiting at this airport for almost 5 hrs for our plane to arrive. Yet again when trying to board we handed the lady our boarding passes and she scanned them and was told they were invalid. Again we had to get out of line and wait until we were cleared by whomever she called about the matter. After finally getting on the plane we waited an additional 20 minutes for a passenger who for some reason or another was late. Finally we landed at Memphis Airport at 11.15pm an hour behind schedule and thank goodness our rental car place was kind enough to wait 20+ minutes after they closed at 11pm so we could get our rental we had reserved. I was hoping our flight home would be less eventful not so lucky! We arrived at Memphis Airport and things went smoothly (I had high hopes after this) we arrived at Orlando FL airport. Once we arrived at Orlando airport things went downhill. We almost immediately found out that our 4.15 flight to Pittsburgh was delayed due to ""weather"" and wouldn't be leaving until 6.45 pm. After trying to figure out a plan we called customer service at Southwest and was told that she didn't know why we were told that our flight was delayed due to weather in fact it had to make an emergency landing in Baltimore due to mechanical issues. 6 long hours later we finally took off around 7pm and arrived at Pittsburgh Airport 5 hrs behind schedule at 11.40pm.

"Today when I showed at the airport I was informed that my flight would be late and that I had to be re-routed. This change puts me at my destination airport approximately 3 hours later than my original ticket. My wife and children now have to pick me up well past their normal bed time (our children are young). Additionally my boarding number is well past what I had checked in with for my original flight (instead of early B I'm now late C). I now have to wait at my departure airport 4.5 hours instead of my planned 1.5 hours. This type of customer handling is unacceptable. Southwest Airlines is supposed to be one of the top tier airlines in regards to customer satisfaction however my treatment today was truly unexpected. I should have been upgraded to business class seating (A1-A15) at least at a discounted price. Instead I was offered nothing for my inconveniences as well as my family's. I truly understand that things happen outside of Southwest's control but I think some concession should have been offered. This would have made me feel better.

"Got delayed due to a maintenance issue with the plane. This happens of course but a few major issues. First they do not make announcements and let people know what is going on. It was past the scheduled departure time before they made any sort of announcement. All the announcement said was ""If you have connecting flights we are looking into possible changes. There is a problem with the plane we have no idea what it is."" Something along those lines. So all you know is that there is a problem with the plane? We all already know that or we would be in the air right now or at least on the plane. Next If you do have delays or cancellations in your flight Southwest does not pull seats from other airlines to book the affected passengers. Other airlines have done this for me in the past. This is obviously a huge issue. You may be waiting all day or even until the next day for another Southwest flight that isn't booked and is flying where you are going. And you can't even really fly to a nearby airport because Southwest doesn't service many cities. Other airlines care about keeping you informed and they will get your flight quickly changed if there is a cancellation or large delay.

I was scheduled to leave for Minneapolis at 7.55 last night. Yes there was a heavy rainstorm and yes flights were delayed.

I make reservations for a flight out that morning at 5.30. Get my ticket go to the gate. Cancelled. So where's the bag that I checked on the flight. They can't provide any answers.

Today was my first time flying with Southwest Airlines and I must say that I am very disappointed. Our connection flight had to be rescheduled by Southwest and by how they scheduled it we had only 30 minutes to make our next flight which turned into 2 minutes when the initial flight was delayed by the airline. Needless to say we did not make our flight. What should have been a five hour travel day turned into an all day travel day which was very long and tiresome for me especially since I am eight months pregnant. It would have made the experience a lot better if Southwest would have somehow reimbursed us for some of the flight or offered us a discount for future flights since the delays were of no fault of our own. The flight attendants were nice and the people at the ticket counters were overall nice but overall the travel experience was very disappointing.

I won't fly Southwest anymore. I was a loyal customer for 13 years. I feel this company has lost sight of there core value Customer service. The idea of adding 6 extra seats to there Boeing 737 configuration is a travesty. The loss of comfort and leg room just to pick up a few extra bucks. My luggage was lost on my last trip from SMF-PDX I was told by the customer service representative that my lost bag (golf clubs) could would not be delivered to Bend OR where I was staying. The new policy of SWA does not provide lost baggage delivery over a distance of 50 miles. So I can wait for the lost bag to arrive later that evening or they would ship it Fed Ex 2-3 business days. That's not going to work when I am only staying for 3 days. The new policy of taking your funds if you miss your flight. I thought that was the reason why the airlines were allowed to oversell flights. So now SWA will oversell the flight and reebook passengers if everyone shows up for the flight.

My last 4 flights out of Nashville have been delayed anyway from 45 minutes to 3 hours. I am a student and I like flying Southwest because of the flight change policy and 2 free bags.

I am thinking of taking a different airline for my future travels. The major reason I had chosen Southwest was the 2 free checked bags but on this last trip there was more damage to the contents of the bags then a fee would have cost me. Since I am pregnant and was tired after my flight I did not check my second bag until the next day and that is when I found the broken items. The bag did not seem damaged and the items where wrapped in towels and other clothes. Customer service said they could not do anything about it though since I did not report it within four hours. So if you choose to use them in the future check your luggage right away.,,Economy Class,,,yes,i am thinking of taking a different airline for my future travels the major reason i had chosen southwest was the 2 free checked bags but on this last trip there was more damage to the contents of the bags then a fee would have cost me since i am pregnant and was tired after my flight i did not check my second bag until the next day and that is when i found the broken items the bag did not seem damaged and the items where wrapped in towels and other clothes customer service said they could not do anything about it though since i did not report it within four hours so if you choose to use them in the future check your luggage right away,thinking taking different airline future travels major reason chosen southwest 2 free checked bags last trip damage contents bags fee would cost since pregnant tired flight check second bag next day found broken items bag seem damaged items wrapped towels clothes customer service said could anything though since report within four hours choose use future check luggage right away,NEU
Had the worst flight ever from South West. We were stuck on the plane from 9am - 7pm PST with no food. My husband 18 month old baby and I were supposed to fly from Raleigh to Portland Oregon. We noted our layovers in Houston and Kansas City and planned on getting food during the stops. When our first flight landed in Houston we were asked at stay in our seats as they would start boarding the next flight. Same thing happened in Kansas City. There was no optional food we could purchase. We were stuck trying to find whatever we could in the diaper bag to feed our little girl. We had also planned on purchasing WiFi to have our daughter watch Netflix which was also unavailable. Insult to injury the last leg of the flight when I went to change my daughter's diaper the sink in the rear bathroom was clogged and the trash was overflowing. I have tried to email Southwest Airlines in hopes to know my complaints were heard and no response. I have also tried Twitter on multiple occasions.,,Economy Class,,,no,had the worst flight ever from south west we were stuck on the plane from 9am  7pm pst with no food my husband 18 month old baby and i were supposed to fly from raleigh to portland oregon we noted our layovers in houston and kansas city and planned on getting food during the stops when our first flight landed in houston we were asked at stay in our seats as they would start boarding the next flight same thing happened in kansas city there was no optional food we could purchase we were stuck trying to find whatever we could in the diaper bag to feed our little girl we had also planned on purchasing wifi to have our daughter watch netflix which was also unavailable insult to injury the last leg of the flight when i went to change my daughters diaper the sink in the rear bathroom was clogged and the trash was overflowing i have tried to email southwest airlines in hopes to know my complaints were heard and no response i have also tried twitter on multiple occasions,worst flight ever south west stuck plane 9am 7pm pst food husband 18 month old baby supposed fly raleigh portland oregon noted layovers houston kansas city planned getting food stops first flight landed houston asked stay seats would start boarding next flight thing happened kansas city optional food could purchase stuck trying find whatever could diaper bag feed little girl also planned purchasing wifi daughter watch netflix also unavailable insult injury last leg flight went change daughters diaper sink rear bathroom clogged trash overflowing tried email southwest airlines hopes know complaints heard response also tried twitter multiple occasions,NEG
"Something seems to have changed at Southwest. For many years SW was the only airline we wanted to fly because: on-time schedules nice staff/crew all around good operation. Recently (week of May 8-15 '14) my family experienced sub quality performance from SW (flights from Dallas and Albuquerque to Orlando and back). Schedules were way off hours late with inaccurate updates that basically said ""we'll fly when we fly"" (weather plays into this but weather has always been an issue and procedures to deal with it efficiently as in giving accurate information should be in place. Flying out of Orlando was a total fiasco. The flight schedule boards and the gate desk showed ""on-time"" departures when in fact the departure time had already passed. Travelers were asking each other for updates from the internet. Finally the flight number completely disappeared from all boards (the SW rep at the gate said after an hour flights are dropped and that he couldn't say when the flight would take off). So 3.5 hours later our plane takes off. Connecting flights of course didn't happen because our flights were at the end of the day. In Phoenix around midnight we were dumped with no customer service desk open to help those who missed their connections to re-schedule. We were lucky enough to find one ticket rep (Homero) who was trying to go home but did help single handedly even though the counter was closed and many people were needing assistance. SW offered no vouchers for future travel and we had to find our own accommodations for the night-the info handout with a number to call for a nearby hotel recommendation with discount had little to offer with no pick-up available. My conclusion is that perhaps SW has gotten too big (with Airtran acquisition) and has lost control of some operations. SW is at its best as a short haul regional airline. Cross country flights (3 hours +) are off schedule and uncomfortable. The good news is that the staff and crew we encountered tried to be helpful but they are powerless when they don't have the information and support that they need.",,Economy Class,,,yes,something seems to have changed at southwest for many years sw was the only airline we wanted to fly because ontime schedules nice staffcrew all around good operation recently week of may 815 14 my family experienced sub quality performance from sw flights from dallas and albuquerque to orlando and back schedules were way off hours late with inaccurate updates that basically said well fly when we fly weather plays into this but weather has always been an issue and procedures to deal with it efficiently as in giving accurate information should be in place flying out of orlando was a total fiasco the flight schedule boards and the gate desk showed ontime departures when in fact the departure time had already passed travelers were asking each other for updates from the internet finally the flight number completely disappeared from all boards the sw rep at the gate said after an hour flights are dropped and that he couldnt say when the flight would take off so 35 hours later our plane takes off connecting flights of course didnt happen because our flights were at the end of the day in phoenix around midnight we were dumped with no customer service desk open to help those who missed their connections to reschedule we were lucky enough to find one ticket rep homero who was trying to go home but did help single handedly even though the counter was closed and many people were needing assistance sw offered no vouchers for future travel and we had to find our own accommodations for the nightthe info handout with a number to call for a nearby hotel recommendation with discount had little to offer with no pickup available my conclusion is that perhaps sw has gotten too big with airtran acquisition and has lost control of some operations sw is at its best as a short haul regional airline cross country flights 3 hours  are off schedule and uncomfortable the good news is that the staff and crew we encountered tried to be helpful but they are powerless when they dont have the information and support that they need,something seems changed southwest many years sw airline wanted fly ontime schedules nice staffcrew around good operation recently week may 815 14 family experienced sub quality performance sw flights dallas albuquerque orlando back schedules way hours late inaccurate updates basically said well fly fly weather plays weather always issue procedures deal efficiently giving accurate information place flying orlando total fiasco flight schedule boards gate desk showed ontime departures fact departure time already passed travelers asking updates internet finally flight number completely disappeared boards sw rep gate said hour flights dropped couldnt say flight would take 35 hours later plane takes connecting flights course didnt happen flights end day phoenix around midnight dumped customer service desk open help missed connections reschedule lucky enough find one ticket rep homero trying go home help single handedly even though counter closed many people needing assistance sw offered vouchers future travel find accommodations nightthe info handout number call nearby hotel recommendation discount little offer pickup available conclusion perhaps sw gotten big airtran acquisition lost control operations sw best short haul regional airline cross country flights 3 hours schedule uncomfortable good news staff crew encountered tried helpful powerless dont information support need,NEU
I have flown Southwest several times. This is my first time to write a review. We flew from Little Rock to Las Vegas. On the way back we were late to board and missed the flight. They put our luggage on another plane and couldn't guarantee when they would get to Little Rock. They put us on a flight to Chicago a little later every seat was full so we were lucky to get on. From Chicago we got a plane to Little Rock again the seats were full so we were lucky again. We were about five hours or so later than if we hadn't missed our original flight. All I can say the Southwest people were very nice about trying to help make the connections and when we got to Little Rock our luggage came in about forty-five minutes later. All I can say about Southwest is good. The flight attendants were very nice too all of them. When we came into Las Vegas the plane went over the Hoover Dam with a very good view I made a comment about the view when I got off and told the pilot I was hoping for a circle around the dam he told me they frowned on that since it would take about another thousand bucks. A little humor thrown in. When I fly it will be with Southwest I have never had any trouble.,,Economy Class,,,yes,i have flown southwest several times this is my first time to write a review we flew from little rock to las vegas on the way back we were late to board and missed the flight they put our luggage on another plane and couldnt guarantee when they would get to little rock they put us on a flight to chicago a little later every seat was full so we were lucky to get on from chicago we got a plane to little rock again the seats were full so we were lucky again we were about five hours or so later than if we hadnt missed our original flight all i can say the southwest people were very nice about trying to help make the connections and when we got to little rock our luggage came in about fortyfive minutes later all i can say about southwest is good the flight attendants were very nice too all of them when we came into las vegas the plane went over the hoover dam with a very good view i made a comment about the view when i got off and told the pilot i was hoping for a circle around the dam he told me they frowned on that since it would take about another thousand bucks a little humor thrown in when i fly it will be with southwest i have never had any trouble,flown southwest several times first time write review flew little rock las vegas way back late board missed flight put luggage another plane couldnt guarantee would get little rock put us flight chicago little later every seat full lucky get chicago got plane little rock seats full lucky five hours later hadnt missed original flight say southwest people nice trying help make connections got little rock luggage came fortyfive minutes later say southwest good flight attendants nice came las vegas plane went hoover dam good view made comment view got told pilot hoping circle around dam told frowned since would take another thousand bucks little humor thrown fly southwest never trouble,POS
This is the first and last time I will fly Southwest. Our flight was delayed from L.A. to Chicago and our connecting flight was also delayed.

I will never fly this Airline again. Flight 37 was to take off at 4.50pm from Houston to Atlanta and due to weather conditions it was delayed which was understandable. However we were never updated on the flight we kept being told that the flight was in route when it apparently wasn't and finally after 5 hours the plane arrived from Dallas - a 1 hour flight. Then we were told after it arrived that the Pilot had timed out and couldn't fly anymore. Just lies and more lies and finally a Supervisor informed us that another flight was supposed to arrive at 12.10 am and at this point we are still waiting.

This was the first and last time I plan to fly with Southwest/Transair. The plane was dirty and noisy. The staff were not pleasant and spent most of their time talking. The internet was so weak the my husband could not watch the show he wanted to without it stalling every few minutes and he could only get the dialogue with a frozen screen. It was a waste of ten dollars for a service that did not work. I am only 5 feet 2 but I could not even get my legs comfortable. There was not choice for a snack and not everyone likes or can have pretzels on their diet. When we exited the plane only one staff member was anywhere near the door but she was not greeting passengers she was cleaning up the food area. I said goodbye and she barely looked up. The pilot did not say two words to us during the flight about where we were until we were about to land. The only good part of the whole experience was the time of day was convenient but I can find that with any airline. I will definitely be going back to the airline I have been using for decades. That way I know what I will be getting for my money.

I think the boarding process with un-assigned seats is outdated and treats folks like cattle. You have no clue if you will be sitting with the person you are traveling with.

I have avoided using Southwest in the past as I don't like lines pushing and shoving or unassigned seating. Nonetheless after hearing about SWA's Business Select Class I decided to give them a try. For about $60 more than the walk-up fare Business Select guarantees the passenger a boarding pass in the A1-A15 group thus being among the first to board. I was thrilled when I checked in online and received boarding pass A-1. The gate room seemed fairly empty and Southwest agents were hawking upgrades for $40 to anyone wanting to move up in the short boarding line. Upon boarding the aircraft I discovered that there were already 90 through passengers already on the airplane. Little overhead space available and mostly middle seats. Although the staff was affable and tried their best I found this to be an extremely uncomfortable way to travel and recommend strongly against wasting money for Business Select.,,Economy Class,,,yes,i have avoided using southwest in the past as i dont like lines pushing and shoving or unassigned seating nonetheless after hearing about swas business select class i decided to give them a try for about 60 more than the walkup fare business select guarantees the passenger a boarding pass in the a1a15 group thus being among the first to board i was thrilled when i checked in online and received boarding pass a1 the gate room seemed fairly empty and southwest agents were hawking upgrades for 40 to anyone wanting to move up in the short boarding line upon boarding the aircraft i discovered that there were already 90 through passengers already on the airplane little overhead space available and mostly middle seats although the staff was affable and tried their best i found this to be an extremely uncomfortable way to travel and recommend strongly against wasting money for business select,avoided using southwest past dont like lines pushing shoving unassigned seating nonetheless hearing swas business select class decided give try 60 walkup fare business select guarantees passenger boarding pass a1a15 group thus among first board thrilled checked online received boarding pass a1 gate room seemed fairly empty southwest agents hawking upgrades 40 anyone wanting move short boarding line upon boarding aircraft discovered already 90 passengers already airplane little overhead space available mostly middle seats although staff affable tried best found extremely uncomfortable way travel recommend strongly wasting money business select,NEU
"Return trip from Denver change in Baltimore than land in Islip NY landing at 8.45pm.

Louisville to Baltimore was canceled and I was the only passenger that they let on all others were stopped and told about the situation.

The airline is fine as far as on time baggage goes through quickly staff are friendly and helpful. However the boarding procedure (no assigned seats) is just a way to charge people for a reasonable line placement. So when considering flying SW with a family that would like sitting together add from 15 to 40 dollars to the price of a ticket and purchase the upgrade. All and all a fine airline for those flying alone but not family friendly.,,Economy Class,,,yes,the airline is fine as far as on time baggage goes through quickly staff are friendly and helpful however the boarding procedure no assigned seats is just a way to charge people for a reasonable line placement so when considering flying sw with a family that would like sitting together add from 15 to 40 dollars to the price of a ticket and purchase the upgrade all and all a fine airline for those flying alone but not family friendly,airline fine far time baggage goes quickly staff friendly helpful however boarding procedure assigned seats way charge people reasonable line placement considering flying sw family would like sitting together add 15 40 dollars price ticket purchase upgrade fine airline flying alone family friendly,POS

Las Vegas to Richmond VA. Booked with AirTran but transported by Southwest from LAS to ATL. Biggest problem I have with Southwest is no seat assignment. That's why I picked AirTran. With Southwest I feel like I'm treated like cattle and herded through the process of boarding the plane. I believe AirTran has the right approach for boarding. That is 1) assigned seats and 2) boarding by zones. I can't understand why the general flying public tolerates Southwest's cattle call boarding.

Vacation to Cabo San Lucas Mexico scheduled 3/1/14. Boarded in Milwaukee with a connection in Denver. When we arrived at check in we were told the flight had been 'overbooked' by 5 passengers. We received the last 2 boarding passes luckily. Upon being seated and waiting for 15 minutes the flight attendant announced that the plane was over-weight and 8 passengers would have to leave. It took another 30 minutes to adjust the weight before we took off - 1 hour after schedule. Upon arriving in Denver an hour late we had to rush to another terminal to catch our connecting flight to Cabo. Flight to Cabo went on schedule until standing at the luggage carousel our 2 pieces of checked luggage never came out. It was not until 30 hours later that our luggage finally showed up. On our return when we checked in at the airport it was announced that our plane was delayed an hour. Taking off to Denver again we realized we were facing a potential connect issue again. Once entering the U.S. we needed to go through customs in Denver before boarding our flight to Milwaukee. Once through customs you need to claim your luggage and then recheck it with Southwest/AirTran. We then had to pass through security before racing to another terminal where our gate was located because of late arrival. We boarded the plane and left for Milwaukee arriving at 10pm on-time. We then went to retrieve our luggage and once again our two bags never showed up.

"Flew from Detroit on Jan 4 2013 flight 2112 to Las Vegas with my 10 year old son who is autistic and has glaucoma. Flight was delayed 2 hours while we waited for a 3rd flight attendant. The gentleman taking tickets was making jokes and doing a comedy routine once we finally got on board his parting shot was ""sorry for the delay hope you had as much fun as we did"". When we landed the flight attendants got on the PA and said ""finally"" like the passengers were responsible for the delay. Missed our connection to Burbank that flight was delayed as well but they apparently could not wait another 20 minutes or so to get the rest of the passengers on. I told the agent I'm flexible and can fly into any airport in Southern California. She seemed to be put out at having to help any of us.

Flew in Sept. 2013 from Nashville to Denver and later Denver to LAX. We were very impressed considering this is a budget airline. Managed to get seats in the 2nd row on both flights for both myself and my elderly mother. Flight attendants were friendly and attentive nice smooth flights new planes very clean. Were most impressed with ground crews in both Denver and LA who allowed my mother and I to board the plane before any general boarding.

LAX-SFO return on 12/09/2013. I like the text message updates early in the day that let you know flights may be late. Before I even left LAX I knew my flight home from SFO would be over 1.5 hours late. That allowed me to finish up early and get back to the airport to try and catch the earlier flight. I did just that and was accommodated on the second to last flight back to LAX. Even though I used points for this trip there was no charge to take the earlier flight. Flights always have drink service and a choice of peanuts/pretzels. Even though they can be stingy when passing the snacks out they never say no when you ask for more and are always nice and polite. In addition I always ask for a kids book with wings to take home for my kid and they gave me two this time - nice touch. So while the assigned seating thing can be a drag they make up for it with outstanding service. And while I was given B51 on the earlier flight to LAX I still managed to get a window sea t so no complaints on the seating. Checking in early is key!,,,,,,laxsfo return on 12092013 i like the text message updates early in the day that let you know flights may be late before i even left lax i knew my flight home from sfo would be over 15 hours late that allowed me to finish up early and get back to the airport to try and catch the earlier flight i did just that and was accommodated on the second to last flight back to lax even though i used points for this trip there was no charge to take the earlier flight flights always have drink service and a choice of peanutspretzels even though they can be stingy when passing the snacks out they never say no when you ask for more and are always nice and polite in addition i always ask for a kids book with wings to take home for my kid and they gave me two this time  nice touch so while the assigned seating thing can be a drag they make up for it with outstanding service and while i was given b51 on the earlier flight to lax i still managed to get a window sea t so no complaints on the seating checking in early is key,laxsfo return 12092013 like text message updates early day let know flights may late even left lax knew flight home sfo would 15 hours late allowed finish early get back airport try catch earlier flight accommodated second last flight back lax even though used points trip charge take earlier flight flights always drink service choice peanutspretzels even though stingy passing snacks never say ask always nice polite addition always ask kids book wings take home kid gave two time nice touch assigned seating thing drag make outstanding service given b51 earlier flight lax still managed get window sea complaints seating checking early key,NEU
I have been on several airlines in my life but Southwest Airlines in my opinion is the worst. The open seating is like a mad zoo. No control people pushing it is the worse possible way I have ever seen to board a plane. Additionally the seats are the smallest and most cramped I've been in. No leg room and a totally miserable experience. I will not fly with them anymore. They have lost me as a customer. However the flight crew is friendly.,,,,,,i have been on several airlines in my life but southwest airlines in my opinion is the worst the open seating is like a mad zoo no control people pushing it is the worse possible way i have ever seen to board a plane additionally the seats are the smallest and most cramped ive been in no leg room and a totally miserable experience i will not fly with them anymore they have lost me as a customer however the flight crew is friendly,several airlines life southwest airlines opinion worst open seating like mad zoo control people pushing worse possible way ever seen board plane additionally seats smallest cramped ive leg room totally miserable experience fly anymore lost customer however flight crew friendly,NEG
I have been a Southwest customer for years and have rarely had problems. Today I was trying to get home for Thanksgiving. I have signed up to get text messages about the status of my flights and until today this has worked out fine. Until today I have received text messages informing me of flight delays which turned out to be accurate. Today I received 2 successive texts telling me that my flight was being delayed first from the original departure time of 5.25pm until 6.00pm and then of a further delay until 6.20pm. When I arrived at my gate about one hour before the scheduled departure time there was no seating available in the area of the gate from which my flight was leaving. I moved to an area of the concourse where the gates are not currently being used so I could sit and elevate my feet. I was actually sitting there when the second text came telling me of the delay until 6.20pm. At 6.10 I got up and walked down to my gate. When I arrived I discovered that the plane had actually departed at 5.50 before I received the second text. When I spoke with the person at the Customer Service desk I was told that I should not have left the gate and that the announcement that the plane was actually leaving at the originally scheduled time could not be heard in the area where I had been sitting. When I asked why I had received a second text message telling me of a further delay after the flight had actually left I was told that the texts are computer generated and are for my convenience only. I was aware that the plane might actually depart later than the time given in the text message but it had never occurred to me that it might depart earlier than the time predicted by the texts. I was told that my options were to wait for ten next flight which was due in about two hours fly to Baltimore for a layover then fly to Nashville and arrive at my destination a little before mid-night or pay for a hotel room and take a flight in the morning. I could not face several more hours of great discomfort so I am spending tonight in the Microtel without luggage or medication.,,,,,,i have been a southwest customer for years and have rarely had problems today i was trying to get home for thanksgiving i have signed up to get text messages about the status of my flights and until today this has worked out fine until today i have received text messages informing me of flight delays which turned out to be accurate today i received 2 successive texts telling me that my flight was being delayed first from the original departure time of 525pm until 600pm and then of a further delay until 620pm when i arrived at my gate about one hour before the scheduled departure time there was no seating available in the area of the gate from which my flight was leaving i moved to an area of the concourse where the gates are not currently being used so i could sit and elevate my feet i was actually sitting there when the second text came telling me of the delay until 620pm at 610 i got up and walked down to my gate when i arrived i discovered that the plane had actually departed at 550 before i received the second text when i spoke with the person at the customer service desk i was told that i should not have left the gate and that the announcement that the plane was actually leaving at the originally scheduled time could not be heard in the area where i had been sitting when i asked why i had received a second text message telling me of a further delay after the flight had actually left i was told that the texts are computer generated and are for my convenience only i was aware that the plane might actually depart later than the time given in the text message but it had never occurred to me that it might depart earlier than the time predicted by the texts i was told that my options were to wait for ten next flight which was due in about two hours fly to baltimore for a layover then fly to nashville and arrive at my destination a little before midnight or pay for a hotel room and take a flight in the morning i could not face several more hours of great discomfort so i am spending tonight in the microtel without luggage or medication,southwest customer years rarely problems today trying get home thanksgiving signed get text messages status flights today worked fine today received text messages informing flight delays turned accurate today received 2 successive texts telling flight delayed first original departure time 525pm 600pm delay 620pm arrived gate one hour scheduled departure time seating available area gate flight leaving moved area concourse gates currently used could sit elevate feet actually sitting second text came telling delay 620pm 610 got walked gate arrived discovered plane actually departed 550 received second text spoke person customer service desk told left gate announcement plane actually leaving originally scheduled time could heard area sitting asked received second text message telling delay flight actually left told texts computer generated convenience aware plane might actually depart later time given text message never occurred might depart earlier time predicted texts told options wait ten next flight due two hours fly baltimore layover fly nashville arrive destination little midnight pay hotel room take flight morning could face several hours great discomfort spending tonight microtel without luggage medication,NEU

I fly with Southwest Airlines frequently. In fact I hardly ever fly with any other US carrier. This does not mean that I love the airline merely that by US standards it is not bad. Some flights go well and the crew are a lot of fun. This was especially the case on both flights I took on 28 October from San Francisco to Phoenix and from Phoenix to Minneapolis. The crew were friendly told jokes and made me feel almost refreshed despite having a long Osaka-Hong Kong-San Francisco flight the day before. At times the flights either leave much to be desired or can be almost horrific as was the case on both flights I took with them on the 7th of October -- Minneapolis to Phoenix Phoenix to San Francisco. Surly crews with terrible service. Those two flights drained me more than the flight to Hong Kong despite having less than half the travelling time combined. Most flights are fairly pleasant if unremarkable. Despite the hits and misses I will likely continue flying with Southwest Airlines because they do not charge as many fees and generally speaking do their job with greater efficiency than any other domestic US carrier.,,,,,,i fly with southwest airlines frequently in fact i hardly ever fly with any other us carrier this does not mean that i love the airline merely that by us standards it is not bad some flights go well and the crew are a lot of fun this was especially the case on both flights i took on 28 october from san francisco to phoenix and from phoenix to minneapolis the crew were friendly told jokes and made me feel almost refreshed despite having a long osakahong kongsan francisco flight the day before at times the flights either leave much to be desired or can be almost horrific as was the case on both flights i took with them on the 7th of october  minneapolis to phoenix phoenix to san francisco surly crews with terrible service those two flights drained me more than the flight to hong kong despite having less than half the travelling time combined most flights are fairly pleasant if unremarkable despite the hits and misses i will likely continue flying with southwest airlines because they do not charge as many fees and generally speaking do their job with greater efficiency than any other domestic us carrier,fly southwest airlines frequently fact hardly ever fly us carrier mean love airline merely us standards bad flights go well crew lot fun especially case flights took 28 october san francisco phoenix phoenix minneapolis crew friendly told jokes made feel almost refreshed despite long osakahong kongsan francisco flight day times flights either leave much desired almost horrific case flights took 7th october minneapolis phoenix phoenix san francisco surly crews terrible service two flights drained flight hong kong despite less half travelling time combined flights fairly pleasant unremarkable despite hits misses likely continue flying southwest airlines charge many fees generally speaking job greater efficiency domestic us carrier,NEU

I recently flew to New York City and my airport was LaGuardia. The flight to New York was fine and went without a problem. However my return flight home where I was on a time crunch was quite different. I recognize that the delay in getting home was due to lighting strikes in the area not an organizational management issue of SW and for safety considerations all flights in and out of LaGuardia were delayed. The terminal at LaGuardia is far too small to accommodate the business for Southwest especially when an unforeseen event occurs as in this case. SW had one Customer Care representative trying to handle a large number of passengers. Finally another representative showed up. Then appeared a supervisor who decided to make an issue with his subordinate about how long his break was to be I have never witnessed such unprofessional behavior at an airline counter as this. It was unbearable in that worn out terminal - nowhere to sit people sitting on the floor in walkways and exit ways. I stood in- line again just to be given misinformation from that same supervisor/manager that there would no problem. After 5.5 hours in that crowed musty terminal I went out of security back down to the check-in counter where I found a representative who was helpful.

From Vegas back to San Francisco. In Group B I was one of the first people to board the plane. When I heard my group being called I stood in line in the right number section that was written on my boarding pass. Following the people in line in front of me I presented my boarding pass to the attendant and she responded in such a rude way I never want to fly Southwest again. As I presented my boarding pass without eye contact she handed it back to me. Instead of placing it back in my hand she practically tossed it to me landing on the ground. She instead grumbled this isn't your group. Please wait to board when I call your group. Confused I replied is this group B?” She stared at the pass for a while and responded “Oh I thought I called the wrong group!” And finally let me board.

I'm Executive Platinum with AA and as we live in Austin AA is usually our carrier of choice. Recent trip to LAS we booked Southwest for the non-stops on this round trip. Never been on Southwest before and I was sure they were not going to match AA. Paid for Early Boarding and received low A group boarding on both flights. Their airport kiosks for bag drop is very user friendly and both flights were the fastest check in I've experienced. I don't mind paying baggage fees when I have to but the 2 bags free policy was a nice change. Boarding was organized and everyone paid close attention as where to stand in line. The planes are very clean and the seats for coach are great. Standard legroom and the open seating was fine for this trip. Very fast boarding they may be on to something here. Fast on board service without carts in the aisle. Overall a very nice trip and would easily use Southwest again for certain trips out of Austin. They do serve a niche.,,,,,,im executive platinum with aa and as we live in austin aa is usually our carrier of choice recent trip to las we booked southwest for the nonstops on this round trip never been on southwest before and i was sure they were not going to match aa paid for early boarding and received low a group boarding on both flights their airport kiosks for bag drop is very user friendly and both flights were the fastest check in ive experienced i dont mind paying baggage fees when i have to but the 2 bags free policy was a nice change boarding was organized and everyone paid close attention as where to stand in line the planes are very clean and the seats for coach are great standard legroom and the open seating was fine for this trip very fast boarding they may be on to something here fast on board service without carts in the aisle overall a very nice trip and would easily use southwest again for certain trips out of austin they do serve a niche,im executive platinum aa live austin aa usually carrier choice recent trip las booked southwest nonstops round trip never southwest sure going match aa paid early boarding received low group boarding flights airport kiosks bag drop user friendly flights fastest check ive experienced dont mind paying baggage fees 2 bags free policy nice change boarding organized everyone paid close attention stand line planes clean seats coach great standard legroom open seating fine trip fast boarding may something fast board service without carts aisle overall nice trip would easily use southwest certain trips austin serve niche,POS

Our first and last time using Southwest. We flew from New York (LGA) to Chicago (MDW) over the Labor Day weekend. Outbound trip was ok but the return was chaotic. Our return flight was scheduled for an 8pm departure but was delayed to 11pm due to some weather issues which we can understand. However they kept changing the departure status from 11pm to 10.30pm to 9.10pm and then to 9.45pm. When they changed it to 9.10pm this was when we had to scramble to the airport. We managed to make it to Midway but we were scattered on the plane even when we had Boarding group A.

Horrible experience coming home from Disneyworld in Orlando on Saturday August 31. The Southwest flight from Orlando to Chicago missed the connecting flight to Philadelphia by about 10 minutes. We were put on standby for the next flight to Philadelphia 4 hours later but they did not have 4 tickets for my family for that flight (but they sent our checked-in luggage back to Philadelphia on that flight). We were then told at the MDW Southwest desk that there was no flight to Philadelphia for another 3 days but that Southwest was not offering us any overnight lodging or meal vouchers. We were incredulous. At least a dozen other Philadelphians were stranded.

Definitely not for families as you will have to be seated separately throughout the plane. The initial airfare is low until you pay the extra fees for earlier check-in times so you get a chance to sit together. I checked in 2 hours early sat in the back seat where the cabin narrows very uncomfortable and my family was spread throughout the plane. To my surprise flight attendants got up after sitting in passenger allocated seating after everyone had boarded and joked about empty seats! This airline is a nightmare!

I fly every other week and have been a loyal SW customer for years. I have however noticed that more and more recently over the past year that my flights are delayed.

More frequent and longer delays have me worried about the future and continuing to use SW exclusively.

23-27 May 2013 Columbus OH - CMH to Ft. Lauderdale FL - FLL. Southwest is our preferred airline and we fly 3-5 times a year. Every time we've used another airline (because someone else was booking the flights or Southwest flights for the times we needed were full) we've regretted it. When we first flew Southwest it took us awhile to get used to how seats are chosen because we'd always flown airlines that had assigned seats. Now we just pay the extra $10 per person for early boarding and make friends with the people around us who are waiting to board.

I had a connection in ATL on my way to BWI after taxiing out we went back to the gate with mechanical issues. The de-icer warning light came on. They told us we would have to wait for the plane to be fixed as there were no available planes after de-boarding they said they had found another plane for us. It got us to our destination 5 hours late I missed my shuttle and had to rent a car to arrive at my destination on time. I called SWA and they willingly issued me a travel voucher for $300 to cover the cost of the car. I was happy with this compromise although cash would have been best. The crew etc were fine no issues there. The only thing I can say and it might be too critical is I would have expected them to be more proactive about reimbursing for the inconvenience.,,,,,,i had a connection in atl on my way to bwi after taxiing out we went back to the gate with mechanical issues the deicer warning light came on they told us we would have to wait for the plane to be fixed as there were no available planes after deboarding they said they had found another plane for us it got us to our destination 5 hours late i missed my shuttle and had to rent a car to arrive at my destination on time i called swa and they willingly issued me a travel voucher for 300 to cover the cost of the car i was happy with this compromise although cash would have been best the crew etc were fine no issues there the only thing i can say and it might be too critical is i would have expected them to be more proactive about reimbursing for the inconvenience,connection atl way bwi taxiing went back gate mechanical issues deicer warning light came told us would wait plane fixed available planes deboarding said found another plane us got us destination 5 hours late missed shuttle rent car arrive destination time called swa willingly issued travel voucher 300 cover cost car happy compromise although cash would best crew etc fine issues thing say might critical would expected proactive reimbursing inconvenience,NEU

I will never fly Southwest again even though they were $300 cheaper than the opposition. I have never had this many flight delays in my 10 years of flying combined that I have had with SWA in the last 2 days! The weather has been good! If you want to save money and don't care about things like arriving/departing on time they aren't that bad. Also I am not a fan of the royal rumble/every man for his own seat scenario that plays out every flight. I sincerely felt as if we were playing musical chair every time that we dumped off another filled-to the seats load that we just picked up on our fourth stop. Putting my bag way in the front and then hiking to the back for my seat wasn't a blast either. All in all the savings in my opinion does not warrant the lack of professional services that should be granted from an airline.,,,,,,i will never fly southwest again even though they were 300 cheaper than the opposition i have never had this many flight delays in my 10 years of flying combined that i have had with swa in the last 2 days the weather has been good if you want to save money and dont care about things like arrivingdeparting on time they arent that bad also i am not a fan of the royal rumbleevery man for his own seat scenario that plays out every flight i sincerely felt as if we were playing musical chair every time that we dumped off another filledto the seats load that we just picked up on our fourth stop putting my bag way in the front and then hiking to the back for my seat wasnt a blast either all in all the savings in my opinion does not warrant the lack of professional services that should be granted from an airline,never fly southwest even though 300 cheaper opposition never many flight delays 10 years flying combined swa last 2 days weather good want save money dont care things like arrivingdeparting time arent bad also fan royal rumbleevery man seat scenario plays every flight sincerely felt playing musical chair every time dumped another filledto seats load picked fourth stop putting bag way front hiking back seat wasnt blast either savings opinion warrant lack professional services granted airline,NEU
"LAX-LAS-DEN flight delayed due to mechanical problems. After a 2 hr delay gate agent announced we would receive $100 vouchers off future travel.

Southwest airlines was able to give me the worst experience I ever had flying in an airplane which is very difficult considering I am on a flight 3-4 days a week. This was on Flight 110 from FLL to BNA on May 20 the flight was initially delayed for a short period of time due to ground delay and then a ground stop. However 60 minutes into waiting on the runway the flight had to return to the gate because they were out of required fuel. I have spent my share of long waits on runway but never had a flight turnback for fuel for a delay of 60-90 mins. This speaks about Southwest's abject lack of focus on customer service and complete focus on economics. The flight pushed back from gate after 1.20pm even though the gate was closed 5-10 mins before it and its now 3.03pm we are parked at the gate waiting for fuel refill. There hasn't been a single word or indication of when the expected time of departure or ETA is and the flight staff seem to be only smiling at our misery.,,,,,,southwest airlines was able to give me the worst experience i ever had flying in an airplane which is very difficult considering i am on a flight 34 days a week this was on flight 110 from fll to bna on may 20 the flight was initially delayed for a short period of time due to ground delay and then a ground stop however 60 minutes into waiting on the runway the flight had to return to the gate because they were out of required fuel i have spent my share of long waits on runway but never had a flight turnback for fuel for a delay of 6090 mins this speaks about southwests abject lack of focus on customer service and complete focus on economics the flight pushed back from gate after 120pm even though the gate was closed 510 mins before it and its now 303pm we are parked at the gate waiting for fuel refill there hasnt been a single word or indication of when the expected time of departure or eta is and the flight staff seem to be only smiling at our misery,southwest airlines able give worst experience ever flying airplane difficult considering flight 34 days week flight 110 fll bna may 20 flight initially delayed short period time due ground delay ground stop however 60 minutes waiting runway flight return gate required fuel spent share long waits runway never flight turnback fuel delay 6090 mins speaks southwests abject lack focus customer service complete focus economics flight pushed back gate 120pm even though gate closed 510 mins 303pm parked gate waiting fuel refill hasnt single word indication expected time departure eta flight staff seem smiling misery,NEG

CMH-MDW-LGA return. Definitely a value airline when the tickets are purchased well in advance at a cheap price. Southwest offers up to 2 free baggage check-ins and that definitely beats most other airlines who charge extra for checked-in baggage. You get a free drink and peanuts/pretzels so cannot complain. The real negative thing about WN may be its inability to accrue miles on major mileage systems. They have their own system but the benefits are quite limited even when you become the A-list. Another downside of WN may be its tight operation of aircraft's. As they operate on such a tight schedule one delay could trigger something like a domino effect. My final concern is about the seating order as somehow more and more people seems to be getting priority status so even a web check-in well in advance will barely get you in the A section. As a matter of fact I have been hearing that even with Early Bird Check-in purchase the seating order may turn out to be worse than you expected.

"Got stuck in Kansas City last night due to the storm and was the only flight out before Friday so I jumped on. Well even with the new seating line-up and a B assignment so I was able to snag an aisle seat it still was pretty unpleasant. Plane was full ran out of overhead bins people were grumpy seats seemed really tight and just overall was not a very good experience. I was willing to pay extra for ""business class"" but they were already taken. I might be in the minority however I will gladly pay a little more for an assigned seat plenty of overhead and a slightly less full flight on some of the other carriers that I fly on a weekly basis. This is not an airline for business travelers.

"Several flights over the last couple of months the most recent which was DAL-STL-BWI-LIT-DAL. Online check-in and bag check has been painless crews have been friendly and occasionally even entertaining and all flights have either been on-time if not a little early. Flights have been on a variety of 737s (300 500 and 700 series) both with the new and old seats. All seats provide 32-33"" pitch and better legroom than most domestic carriers. However planes with the newer seats can be a little uncomfortable on the thighs after 3 hours or so beware on longer flights. Price of WiFi has recently been increased to $8 or $5 for streaming TV/movies only but you can access Southwest.com a shopping site and a flight tracker for free. Free soft drinks are provided along with either peanuts/pretzels and/or a bag of chips (only on longer flights). I paid for EarlyBird on some flights checked in exactly 24 hours before on others and forgot a couple of times and checked in a few hours after. Beware that if you either don't pay for EarlyBird or forget to check-in exactly 24 hours in advance you will end up in the mid-B group and you will have your carry-on checked as bin space runs out by that point.

"Flew round-trip SJC-LAS-SJC outbound on Sep 11 (flight 328) returning on Sep 14 (flight 259). The outbound flight was delayed 4 hours. Initially we had to wait for a couple of hours due to bad weather in LAS. That issue is not the airline's responsibility of course. However after we were told that LAS airport was open again we were delayed by about an hour because staff were not able to match the people on board with their passenger manifest. Cabin crew went through the cabin 3 times counting the number of passengers. A ground staff member went through the plane and checked our ID's one by one. Passengers were getting irritated as the clock ticked. Eventually they figured out that 1) a passenger made it into the plane without turning in a boarding pass and 2) a passenger was now without ID because the ground person checking the ID's left the aircraft with the ID and did not return it to the passenger. / Overall I think it was ""nicely done under the circumstances"" but the ground/gate agent(s) made things harder for the passengers and the cabin crew.

We can all agree the airline industry is at an all time low. My experience with SWA yesterday restores my faith that someone cares about passengers. A four hr delay at Midway - airport staff were apologetic and sincere the crew were accommodating and we received an unexpected $100 voucher. SWA used to be the cheapest but the fares have gone up. I believe to cover free baggage. But in our case it was cheaper because the fees on the other airlines made their flights higher. I know their are a lot of complaints about seats. I used to hate SWA for that reason. I also don't like that the 24hr checkin still gives you only an A30 at best since they sell the first half of the A seats now for business select or a fee. But if you check in early you still have a good selection. The other airlines are sneakier. You may get an assigned seat but do you really have a choice? Most of my recent flights have shown me a chart selection of all centre seats and the aisles and windows for sale!

Two round trips so far have been excellent in every respect: on time easy boarding pleasant crew (glad to say official flight time is under 2 hours; can't comment on comfort on a longer haul.) Of course SW is known for the several special ways it rises above the competition: consistently cheap fares (at least for our route) those two pieces of free checked baggage and the free reservation changes.

RNO-DEN-IAD-BWI-LAS-RNO. Good fares pleasant staff on-time for the most part and when a delay comes up we are informed. This trip held true to that again. But my only issue on this trip and it is not a fault but rather a comment. Flying cross country non-stop on a 737 for 5 hours is a bit brutal. We did get on a brand new 737-800 for the longest sector from BWI to LAS which was nice but still a very long trip on a small plane that was packed to the hilt. The crew were pleasant on all sectors. The ground staff at BWI were great and the Skycap had us laughing. All in all a good product with no complaints really. Just remember to buy a meal before you get on a long flight and if you don't mind a long flight on a small plane then Southwest is the way to go.

Southwest are a cheap and cheerful airline and you get what you pay for. The cabin crew are generally friendly and helpful the aircraft's clean although seating is tight as you would expect on a budget airline.

They are with rare exception a miserable unhelpful lot who seem to think their faces would break if they smiled. The check-in system is different to what I am used to and the counter staff seemed to look down their noses in disdain when I was not sure how things worked.

Southwest avoids punishing customers with extra fees such as change cancellation or bag check fees where possible. If you happen to check your bags late they will accept them and try their best to get them on the plane often faster than you can make it to the gate.

My wife and I have flown Southwest often in the past. We've watched the past couple years as Southwest has made cutbacks and the value of their service has declined.

In the past I have always been very happy with Southwest however after today I am extremely upset. I had purchased a ticket of which I was not able to use.

I called customer service to request an extension ($50.00 fee of which I would happily pay). I am told that I have to wait for the credit to expire prior to their ability to extend the credit.

"Never flying Southwest again. Their boarding/seating process is horrible and needlessly stressful; their ""new hip"" thing among flight staff is really annoying. My fiancé and I flew across the country to get married last weekend. Of course we wanted to sit together on the 5 hour flight. But with the ridiculous system of no assigned seats there was no way to assure this. On the way back we got stuck in separate seats surrounded by a yelling and singing boy scout troop. To make things worse the flight attendants cranked up the volume on the PA system and sang the safety demonstration. In fact all announcements were done in song. This should be illegal. They seemed to think it was clever but it was a real nightmare to be strapped into one of those tiny seats surrounded by pimply screaming boy scouts and then endure warbling flight attendants blasting through the overhead speakers.

"Extremely disappointed in Southwest's recent changes to the policy on the inability to change a passenger name once the ticket has been purchased. I bought a ticket for an employee before this policy took effect who was not able to make the trip. Since then SW started supposedly ""enforcing a policy that has been in place"" without any sort of notification. Now I'm out almost $500 because they won't refund the ticket or allow me to use the credit for another passenger - even if it's just transferred to my name. Their reason when I filed a complaint? ""a proactive step to align our business with the general practice of the airline industry"" So it seems SW is in fact purposefully intending to become just another airline. The really upsetting part is that only a week or two earlier another trip for an employee had to be cancelled and I was able to use the flight credit for someone else. Suddenly I can't. No notification at all. I get emails just about every other day from SW advertising their ""get- away"" deals; couldn't they have simply sent out an email letting us know their policy was going to go into effect? I was an extremely loyal SW customer but they've lost my business for good.

Travelled SW for the first time because my son gave me and my husband SW giftcards so we booked a trip to Vegas. We paid the extra $10. each was for early bird seating we got A section between 15 and 30 that was good. I think if you are flying as a couple it is worth the extra so you can sit together.

Boston to Norfolk via Baltimore early morning. Boston to Baltimore fine but probably only because the flight was nearly empty and I could sleep. Legroom better than on other legacy carriers.

Is Southwest becoming too big? It used to be one of the few airlines I could rely on for great customer service and quality. But it seems that with the acquisition of Airtran they also acquired the bad habits of big airlines. My last trip with them was a headache that cost me $500. I got stuck in Chicago for one night and received attitude from the crew when I tried to address the issue. It is great that they don't charge for luggage but I'm curious to see how long that is going to last.,,,,,,is southwest becoming too big it used to be one of the few airlines i could rely on for great customer service and quality but it seems that with the acquisition of airtran they also acquired the bad habits of big airlines my last trip with them was a headache that cost me 500 i got stuck in chicago for one night and received attitude from the crew when i tried to address the issue it is great that they dont charge for luggage but im curious to see how long that is going to last,southwest becoming big used one airlines could rely great customer service quality seems acquisition airtran also acquired bad habits big airlines last trip headache cost 500 got stuck chicago one night received attitude crew tried address issue great dont charge luggage im curious see long going last,NEU
"Beware more and more Southwest is just another airline. Latest casualty is the previously elegant Rapid Rewards program which used to be 16 credits=1 free flight virtually no restrictions. It has now devolved into just another points system with ever more restrictions. During the transition they are still using Awards which was the mechanism by which you reaped the reward of a free flight. But do not convert points into an award - if you do so mistakenly you will never get them converted back into points. Found this out trying to book a flight by converting to award first which was akin to the previous protocol but the flight had ""no"" award seats available. You could buy a seat with your points but after conversion to award I didn't have enough points available and Southwest has made their system physically incapable of correcting the conversion not even during this period of new learning for their customers. They make no statement that I could find that such conversions are irrevocable. In other words if you make a mistake too bad - you can pay for a ticket but Southwest won't help you correct your points v. award error and you have to wait for another flight within the coming year to use it. Yes the award expires though the points do not while you continue to generate trip activity.",,,,,,beware more and more southwest is just another airline latest casualty is the previously elegant rapid rewards program which used to be 16 credits1 free flight virtually no restrictions it has now devolved into just another points system with ever more restrictions during the transition they are still using awards which was the mechanism by which you reaped the reward of a free flight but do not convert points into an award  if you do so mistakenly you will never get them converted back into points found this out trying to book a flight by converting to award first which was akin to the previous protocol but the flight had no award seats available you could buy a seat with your points but after conversion to award i didnt have enough points available and southwest has made their system physically incapable of correcting the conversion not even during this period of new learning for their customers they make no statement that i could find that such conversions are irrevocable in other words if you make a mistake too bad  you can pay for a ticket but southwest wont help you correct your points v award error and you have to wait for another flight within the coming year to use it yes the award expires though the points do not while you continue to generate trip activity,beware southwest another airline latest casualty previously elegant rapid rewards program used 16 credits1 free flight virtually restrictions devolved another points system ever restrictions transition still using awards mechanism reaped reward free flight convert points award mistakenly never get converted back points found trying book flight converting award first akin previous protocol flight award seats available could buy seat points conversion award didnt enough points available southwest made system physically incapable correcting conversion even period new learning customers make statement could find conversions irrevocable words make mistake bad pay ticket southwest wont help correct points v award error wait another flight within coming year use yes award expires though points continue generate trip activity,NEG

"Travelled Southwest for the first time round trip Manchester Phoenix. Cannot understand the open seating ""gimmick"" this airline uses. On the return trip we were not able to participate in the competition to call within 24 hours and get an ""earlier"" boarding assignment as we were travelling in a remote area with no cell coverage. Therefore as we were among the last to board we (and many other couples) were not able to sit together. The flight attendants ""helped"" by continuing to instruct us to just ""find a seat single seats only available"". We ended up separated by 20 rows. The reason for this practice must have something to do with saving the airline money because there is no apparent benefit for passengers. But the on line seat selection process that all the other airlines use is obviously computerized and can't cost much if anything to oversee so why does Southwest do this?? Certainly feels like one of those brilliant ideas the management team comes up with that blindly ignores the needs of some passengers.

As a young inexperienced traveler I relied on our travel agent to recommend the best airline for our honeymoon. She recommended Southwest as the best. We book at a reasonable rate for the holiday season as soon as tickets became available. Everything was good to go until we got our tickets with no seat number. We ended up being one of the last people on the plane with only a few middle seat left scattered across the plane when we got on. Then we saw an open pair together only to be rudely told by a stewardess that they were reserved in case another family boarded. I politely said how about a new family we just got married. She rudely said no find a seat and turned around. Luckily a kind man gave us his seat so we could sit together but the rest of the trip we full of rude comments from the stewardess about how she couldn't believe he moved!,,,,,,as a young inexperienced traveler i relied on our travel agent to recommend the best airline for our honeymoon she recommended southwest as the best we book at a reasonable rate for the holiday season as soon as tickets became available everything was good to go until we got our tickets with no seat number we ended up being one of the last people on the plane with only a few middle seat left scattered across the plane when we got on then we saw an open pair together only to be rudely told by a stewardess that they were reserved in case another family boarded i politely said how about a new family we just got married she rudely said no find a seat and turned around luckily a kind man gave us his seat so we could sit together but the rest of the trip we full of rude comments from the stewardess about how she couldnt believe he moved,young inexperienced traveler relied travel agent recommend best airline honeymoon recommended southwest best book reasonable rate holiday season soon tickets became available everything good go got tickets seat number ended one last people plane middle seat left scattered across plane got saw open pair together rudely told stewardess reserved case another family boarded politely said new family got married rudely said find seat turned around luckily kind man gave us seat could sit together rest trip full rude comments stewardess couldnt believe moved,POS
We were forced to change our scheduled departure from New Orleans because my partner became seriously ill. We departed New Orleans three days early. We paid $200.00 in additional fees for the flight rescheduling which to me was acceptable by today's rules. I asked Southwest for a refund of the Early Bird Seating fee ($20.00) sending them the hospital and rescheduling documentation. Southwest called and said they would refund $200.00 because of the medical emergency - said they did not believe in taking advantage of their customers. I have always found Southwest Airlines to be fair honest and customer friendly which is why I stay with them.,,,,,,we were forced to change our scheduled departure from new orleans because my partner became seriously ill we departed new orleans three days early we paid 20000 in additional fees for the flight rescheduling which to me was acceptable by todays rules i asked southwest for a refund of the early bird seating fee 2000 sending them the hospital and rescheduling documentation southwest called and said they would refund 20000 because of the medical emergency  said they did not believe in taking advantage of their customers i have always found southwest airlines to be fair honest and customer friendly which is why i stay with them,forced change scheduled departure new orleans partner became seriously ill departed new orleans three days early paid 20000 additional fees flight rescheduling acceptable todays rules asked southwest refund early bird seating fee 2000 sending hospital rescheduling documentation southwest called said would refund 20000 medical emergency said believe taking advantage customers always found southwest airlines fair honest customer friendly stay,NEU
My original ticket from Palm Beach Florida to Denver Colorado was screwed up through American Airlines. They wanted to charge me $900 to fix it. I was trying to figure out something to do and ended up talked to agents at SWA and without a thought they started working the problem for me. By the end of the it I had a ticket for $400 and was set to go! They took care of everything and I was on my way before I knew what to do.,,,,,,my original ticket from palm beach florida to denver colorado was screwed up through american airlines they wanted to charge me 900 to fix it i was trying to figure out something to do and ended up talked to agents at swa and without a thought they started working the problem for me by the end of the it i had a ticket for 400 and was set to go they took care of everything and i was on my way before i knew what to do,original ticket palm beach florida denver colorado screwed american airlines wanted charge 900 fix trying figure something ended talked agents swa without thought started working problem end ticket 400 set go took care everything way knew,NEG
More and more disenchanted with Southwest. Used them three times this summer and the experience got worse each time. Southwest check in and other representatives rude. No wonder the bags fly free Southwest has no intention of taking reasonable care with them. Now we have discovered that they make you sign a waiver saying that they aren't responsible if your golf clubs don't arrive at your destination or if they are damaged in transit. Also on our last two flights the attendants made the safety briefing into a real joke and didn't even complete it properly. It is nice to try to make flying fun but I think that they are crossing the line. Not all customers are frequent flyers who are familiar with the safety aspects of a plane. They used to be my favorite airline but not anymore. They are not always the least expensive and definitely lack customer service.,,,,,,more and more disenchanted with southwest used them three times this summer and the experience got worse each time southwest check in and other representatives rude no wonder the bags fly free southwest has no intention of taking reasonable care with them now we have discovered that they make you sign a waiver saying that they arent responsible if your golf clubs dont arrive at your destination or if they are damaged in transit also on our last two flights the attendants made the safety briefing into a real joke and didnt even complete it properly it is nice to try to make flying fun but i think that they are crossing the line not all customers are frequent flyers who are familiar with the safety aspects of a plane they used to be my favorite airline but not anymore they are not always the least expensive and definitely lack customer service,disenchanted southwest used three times summer experience got worse time southwest check representatives rude wonder bags fly free southwest intention taking reasonable care discovered make sign waiver saying arent responsible golf clubs dont arrive destination damaged transit also last two flights attendants made safety briefing real joke didnt even complete properly nice try make flying fun think crossing line customers frequent flyers familiar safety aspects plane used favorite airline anymore always least expensive definitely lack customer service,NEG
Phoenix to Detroit. Very good service. Had a toddler travelling with us and check-in was super efficient. It took less than five minutes and we were off with our boarding passes. I travel Southwest at least once a month and I will continue to travel with them even if their prices increase.,,,,,,phoenix to detroit very good service had a toddler travelling with us and checkin was super efficient it took less than five minutes and we were off with our boarding passes i travel southwest at least once a month and i will continue to travel with them even if their prices increase,phoenix detroit good service toddler travelling us checkin super efficient took less five minutes boarding passes travel southwest least month continue travel even prices increase,POS
